# pnm-browser-plugin

Browser-side bridge between **WebAuthn passkeys** and **VTA-managed
DIDs**. Lets an operator prove control of a DID hosted in a remote
Verifiable Trust Agent by performing a passkey ceremony in the
browser — no DID private keys ever leave the VTA, and no long-lived
bearer token sits in browser storage. Speaks both REST and **full
DIDComm v2** to the VTA, including when the VTA is private-network
and only reachable via a mediator.

## Why

Passkeys solve local user authentication beautifully (synced
keychains, biometric unlock, phishing-resistant). DIDs solve global
identity (self-sovereign, portable, signable). Neither alone solves
"log into a third-party site as the controller of my VTA DID."

This project glues the two together: a passkey is enrolled as a
`verificationMethod` (purpose: `authentication`) in the DID document
the VTA publishes via WebVH. Any verifier that resolves the DID can
then validate a WebAuthn assertion against the embedded public key
without ever talking to the VTA — the DID document *is* the trust
anchor.

Every layer has matching ownership:

- **`@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js`** owns crypto: HPKE-style authcrypt
  (ECDH-1PU + A256CBC-HS512), anoncrypt (ECDH-ES + A256CBC-HS512),
  Ed25519 signatures, Routing 2.0 forward envelopes. Pulled in as
  an npm dependency — no Rust toolchain required to build this
  workspace.
- **@openvtc/pnm-core** owns the wire protocols + transport abstraction.
  REST (`VtaClient`) and DIDComm (`DidcommVtaTransport`) implement
  the same `VtaTransport` interface; pick at boot.
- **Bridge implementations** own network I/O. `WebSocketDidcommBridge`
  is the production bridge (mediator over WSS, Pickup 3.0 live mode
  via `Pickup3Dispatcher`, concurrent thid demuxing).
  `InMemoryDidcommBridge` simulates both mediator and VTA for tests.
- **`WalletSession`** is the only thing the UI talks to. One call —
  `bootstrap()` — does identity load/mint, mediator enrollment (if
  needed), and constructs a ready `VtaTransport`.
- **PWA / extension** are thin shells over `@openvtc/pnm-core`.

## Form factors

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `@openvtc/pnm-core` | Wire types, WebAuthn ceremony helpers, COSE→Multikey conversion, DID `verificationMethod` builder, REST + DIDComm transports, mediator client, bridges, wallet orchestration. |
| `@openvtc/pnm-pwa` | Installable web app (Vite + React 19). Operator-facing wallet for connecting to a VTA and managing passkeys. Has a `/smokes` diagnostic page that runs the in-browser smoke suite. |
| `@openvtc/pnm-extension` | Manifest v3 browser extension. Same flows, plus future ability to intercept RP login pages and inject SIOPv2/OpenID4VP responses. |

## First milestone — enroll a passkey as a DID `verificationMethod`

1. Operator points the app at a running VTA and authenticates with an
   existing admin credential (the standard `pnm bootstrap connect`
   flow already produces one) — *or* the wallet bootstraps over
   DIDComm via `WalletSession`.
2. App triggers `navigator.credentials.create(...)`. The authenticator
   produces a credential whose public key is COSE-encoded.
3. App parses the COSE_Key, converts it to **W3C Multikey** form
   (multicodec `0x1200` for P-256 / ES256, `0xed01` for Ed25519,
   multibase-base58btc with the `z` prefix).
4. App POSTs `{ credential_id, multikey_pubkey, attestation_object }`
   to the VTA (`POST /did/verification-methods/passkey` — new endpoint,
   see [docs/passkey-did-binding.md](docs/passkey-did-binding.md) for the
   contract).
5. VTA appends a WebVH LogEntry adding the VM with `id =
   <did>#passkey-<sha256(credential_id)>` and purpose
   `authentication`.
6. From then on, any RP can verify a WebAuthn assertion against the
   VM by resolving the DID — no shared secret, no callback to the
   VTA.

## DIDComm-only VTA support

When the VTA has `services rest disable`'d and is only reachable via
its DIDComm mediator, the wallet stack handles it transparently:

```ts
const session = new WalletSession({
  store: new IndexedDBKVStore(),
  mediator: {
    websocketUrl: "wss://mediator.example.com/ws",
    did: "did:key:zMediator…",
    keyAgreementKid: "did:key:zMediator…#key-agreement-1",
    keyAgreementPublicJwk: { kty: "OKP", crv: "X25519", x: "…" },
  },
  vta: {
    did: "did:webvh:vta.example.com:abc",
    keyAgreementKid: "did:webvh:…#key-agreement-1",
    keyAgreementPublicJwk: { kty: "OKP", crv: "X25519", x: "…" },
  },
});

await session.bootstrap();          // mint or load holder, enroll w/ mediator
await session.setLiveDelivery(true);// pickup/3.0 live-mode push
const challenge = await session
  .transport()
  .requestEnrollmentChallenge(holder.did);  // passkey-management/1.0
```

On first run: mints a did:key holder identity, registers with the
mediator (coordinate-mediation/2.0), persists state.

On subsequent runs: loads the holder identity, detects the existing
mediator relationship, skips re-enrollment.

All messages travel as:
- inner: `authcrypt(holder → VTA, passkey-management/1.0/...)`
- wrapped: `routing/2.0/forward` envelope addressed to the VTA
- outer: `anoncrypt(forward → mediator)`

The mediator delivers the inner JWE to the VTA. Replies travel back
via the wallet's mediator inbox, decrypted by `Pickup3Dispatcher`,
and demuxed by `thid` to the waiting Promise.

### Mediator CORS (browser requirement)

The wallet runs **in the browser**, so the mediator's WebSocket
(`wss://…/ws`) and REST (`/inbound`, `/authenticate`, …) endpoints must
allow the **origin the wallet page is served from** — either by echoing
that exact origin in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, or with `*`. This is
a mediator-side configuration; the wallet cannot work around it.

Symptom of a missing/incorrect CORS allow-list: the REST auth handshake
succeeds (or appears to), but opening the live-delivery socket fails with

```
mediator-transport: WebSocket failed to open (close code 1006)
```

A browser rejects a cross-origin WebSocket upgrade *before* the socket
opens, which surfaces as an abnormal **1006** close with no HTTP status —
indistinguishable, from the client side, from a refused upgrade or a
proxy that strips the `Upgrade` header. If REST auth works from the same
page but the WS gives 1006, **check the mediator's CORS allow-list for
your wallet origin first.**

For a self-hosted `affinidi-messaging-mediator`, set the allowed origins
in its config (e.g. `cors_allow_origin`) to include your wallet's origin
(`http://localhost:5173` in dev, your extension/PWA origin in prod), or
`*` for a permissive dev setup. Restart the mediator after changing it.

## End-to-end validation

Six smokes cover the main DIDComm + wallet links. Run from a browser
at `/smokes` or invoke directly via `@openvtc/pnm-core`:

| Smoke | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `smokeAuthcryptRoundtrip` | authcrypt + unpack round-trips intact |
| `smokeBuildDidcommEnrollChallenge` | Full forward+anoncrypt envelope assembly |
| `smokeDidcommVtaTransportRoundtrip` | DIDComm enrollment exchange via in-memory bridge |
| `smokeMediatorEnrollment` | mediate-request → grant → keylist-update |
| `smokeMediatorNotifications` | live-delivery-change + messages-received notifications |
| `smokeWalletBoot` | Full WalletSession bootstrap on first run + resume on second run |

## Status

Scaffold + core enrollment ceremony + REST client + complete DIDComm
v2 stack (authcrypt, anoncrypt, forward, coordinate-mediation/2.0,
pickup/3.0 live mode) + WalletSession orchestrator.

The VTA-side endpoint is documented in
[docs/passkey-did-binding.md](docs/passkey-did-binding.md) but not
yet implemented in `vta-service`; the browser code targets the
documented contract and can be exercised against a mock today.

## Development

Prereqs: Node 24+. No Rust toolchain needed — DIDComm crypto comes
from the `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js` npm package.

```bash
npm install
npm run build              # tsc -b + vite build across TS workspaces
npm run dev:pwa            # http://localhost:5173
npm run dev:extension      # vite watch into packages/extension/dist
```

### Installing the extension into your browser

After `npm run build` (or while `npm run dev:extension` is running),
`packages/extension/dist/` contains a complete unpacked Manifest v3
extension. Side-load it like this:

**Chrome / Edge / Brave / Arc**

1. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`,
   `brave://extensions`, `arc://extensions`).
2. Toggle **Developer mode** on (top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select
   `packages/extension/dist/` from this checkout.
4. Pin **VTA Wallet** to the toolbar (Chrome's puzzle-piece icon →
   pin) so it's one click away.
5. **Setup opens automatically on install.** Work through it top to
   bottom — the order matters. The agent's address comes first because
   its mediator is resolved from it; you're only asked for a mediator
   if the agent publishes none. The passkey lock and your inbox follow.
   You can reopen it any time at **Options → Setup**, or from the
   popup's **Open setup** button.

   The agent field takes either form: an agent name
   (`webvh.storm.ws/@glenn-vta`) or a full `did:webvh:…`. A name is
   resolved in three stages — an HTTPS request that answers with a DID,
   DID resolution, then the document must claim the name back via
   `alsoKnownAs`. The third stage is mandatory: a redirect alone proves
   nothing, since whoever controls a domain can point a name at somebody
   else's DID. The DID is what gets stored; names are re-claimable.

   Stage 1 needs the name's server to answer in a form a *browser* can
   read. The reference (Rust) resolver reads a `did:…` straight out of a
   `Location` header; no browser can, so the wallet sends a browser-shaped
   `Accept` and follows whatever it is given — the webvh hosting service
   answers that with a redirect to the DID's log. A name server that only
   ever answers with a bare `did:` redirect cannot be resolved from an
   extension at all; paste the full `did:webvh:…` instead.

   Onboarding deliberately runs in a tab rather than the toolbar popup:
   Chrome tears the popup down whenever a native dialog takes focus
   (crbug 40721470), and this flow raises two — the host-permission
   grant and the passkey ceremony.
6. Optional extras — a separate approver identity, background wake-up,
   step-up defaults — live under **Advanced** and can wait.

**Firefox**

Not supported out of the box: Firefox's MV3 service-worker support
diverges from Chromium and the manifest would need adjusting. Not in
scope today.

**Reloading after a rebuild**

`npm run dev:extension` rebuilds into `dist/` on change, but Chrome
does not auto-pick up the new bundle for a side-loaded extension.
After each rebuild, click the reload icon on the **VTA Wallet** card
in `chrome://extensions`.

**Debugging**

`chrome://extensions` → **VTA Wallet** → **service worker** opens
DevTools for the background script. The popup, options page, and
offscreen document each have their own DevTools — right-click →
Inspect on the popup, or use the **Inspect views** links on the
extension card.

### Permissions model

The extension requests **no host permissions at install time** and declares
**no static content scripts**. The manifest carries `optional_host_permissions`
only, and the page provider is registered at runtime for granted origins
(`src/content-registration.ts`) — so the install prompt no longer asks to read
and change your data on all websites.

A grant means two things at once: the wallet may talk to that host, and
`window.vtaWallet` exists on its pages. Turning a site off in **Sites** stops
both.

The wallet asks for one origin at a time, at the moment it needs it:

- **Connecting to a VTA** — the host is read out of the `did:webvh` before any
  request is made, and Chrome prompts on the Prepare click. Needed because
  vta-service applies an origin-allowlist CORS layer.
- **Visiting a site for the first time** — the popup shows "Enable on
  <site>". Until then the site cannot see the wallet at all, so its sign-in
  button does nothing; enabling registers the provider and reloads the page.

Resolving DIDs needs no grant: the did:webvh hosting service serves public
resolution with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. A did:webvh host behind a
restrictive CORS policy is the known gap — it surfaces in the consent prompt
as an unresolved DID, which fails closed.

### The wallet writes nothing into your browser

A sign-in produces a signed `id_token` the site verifies for itself by
resolving your published DID document; a DIDComm login never touches browser
state either. The extension holds no `cookies` permission and calls no cookie
API — `chrome.cookies.set` appears nowhere in the source.

It did once. A relying party that was an ordinary web app with a server-side
session and no notion of DIDs could have its login performed by the VTA, which
returned a `SessionBlob` whose cookie jar the wallet wrote into the browser
(guarded by scope checks in what was `src/cookie-scope.ts`). That legacy path
is gone: the `cookies` permission is off the manifest, the vault's password
entries are browser-fill only, and any cookie jar a VTA still returns is
dropped in the offscreen document before it can cross into the popup
(`doVaultProxyLogin`, `src/offscreen.ts`).

What remains of `vault/proxy-login` is the modern half — the VTA mints a SIOP
`id_token` on your behalf and the long-term key never leaves it. The wallet
displays that session; it never installs it. Keep it that way when changing
this code: "the wallet writes nothing into your browser" is a claim a reviewer
can check in one grep, and it is worth more than any scoping argument.

### Packaging for the Chrome Web Store

```bash
npm run package --workspace @openvtc/pnm-extension
# → packages/extension/release/vta-wallet-<version>.zip
```

The zip holds the *contents* of `dist/` (manifest at the archive root,
as the Store requires). CI builds and validates it on every run and
uploads it as the `vta-wallet-extension` artifact, so a submission is
never the first time the packaging path runs.

**Version.** `packages/extension/package.json` is the single source of
truth; `packages/extension/manifest.json` is a template and carries no
`version` field. The build injects it and rejects anything the Store
would reject — npm prerelease spellings like `0.3.0-rc.1` are not valid
Chrome versions. Bump the package version before each upload: the Store
refuses a version that is not greater than the last one it accepted.

**Extension ID.** `chrome.runtime.id` is load-bearing — `src/holder.ts`
uses it as the WebAuthn PRF rpId, so if it changes, every
passkey-wrapped secret becomes unopenable and any
`chrome-extension://<id>` allowlist (VTA CORS) breaks. It is pinned by
`extension-key.txt`, whose public key the build injects into `dist/`'s
manifest as `key`.

The Store zip deliberately omits `key`: the Store issues its own key on
the first upload of a new item and rejects a package that carries one.
So the local ID matches the published one only after cutover — once the
item exists in the Developer Dashboard, replace `extension-key.txt`
with the dashboard's **Package → View public key** value and delete
`extension-key.pem`. Confirm the result:

```bash
npm run generate:key --workspace @openvtc/pnm-extension -- --show
# prints the derived ID; it must equal the dashboard's Item ID
```

Until then the pinned key is a locally generated one (`npm run
generate:key`), which holds the ID still across machines and checkouts
but is *not* the published ID. Cutover re-keys every dev passkey once.

### Validating in a browser

```bash
npm run dev:pwa
# open http://localhost:5173/smokes → click "Run all"
```

All smokes should pass. The diagnostics page exercises every layer
of the stack including the WebSocket bridge's thid demuxer and the
full WalletSession boot.
