 * so that `npm run dev` (`vite build --watch`) keeps the manifest in `dist/`
 * on every rebuild. A chained step would run once and then be wiped by the
 * next watch rebuild's `emptyOutDir`, leaving an unloadable extension.
 *
 * `includeKey: true` — this output is what you load unpacked. The Store zip
 * is produced by `scripts/package.mjs` with the key omitted; see
 * `scripts/manifest.mjs` for why the two differ.
