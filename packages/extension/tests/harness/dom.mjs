// Rendering a console pane in `node --test`: a DOM, an agent, and `act`.
//
// ## What this is for
//
// Every bug the console shipped today lived below the type checker and above
// the tested modules: a `ref` callback that set state and looped the renderer,
// a form that opened empty because a selection was not passed to it, a screen
// that never came back because its mode was decided once. The models under
// them were tested and correct throughout. Rendering is the only thing that
// sees any of it.
//
// ## The agent is a fake, and it answers like the real one
//
// A pane talks to the VTA through `managerSender` → `sendToBackground` →
// `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`, so that one call is where a test can stand in
// for an agent. `agent()` builds the reply shape the relay actually produces —
// `{ ok: true, result: { kind: "accepted", result } }` — because a stub that
// returned the payload bare would let a pane pass while mishandling every real
// response. It answers by task URI, so a test says what the agent holds rather
// than what any particular call returns, and a call to a task the test did not
// name is a **failure**, not an empty answer: a pane asking something
// unexpected is exactly what a test should notice.
//
// ## `act` is not optional
//
// React 19 warns without `IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT`, and more usefully, `act`
// is what flushes effects. The bugs worth catching are effect-shaped, so a test
// that rendered without it would see the first paint and none of the
// consequences.

// fail several screens later — which is exactly how long it took to find.
