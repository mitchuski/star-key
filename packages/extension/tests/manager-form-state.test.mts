// A form seeded from a prop must be keyed on that prop's identity.
//
// ## The bug this exists for
//
// `EditContext` seeds its fields with `useState(record.name)`. That runs on
// mount and never again. The context detail panel is a *single* instance that
// swaps records as the operator moves through the tree, so React reused it —
// and every context showed the FIRST context's name, in an editable field,
// sitting directly above the correct id, DID and timestamps.
//
// It reads as a display glitch and is not one. The field is the input to
// `contextsUpdate`, so an operator pressing Save would have renamed the context
// they were looking at to the name of one they were not — a write, from a
// screen that showed them the right record everywhere else.
//
// Nothing could have caught it. It typechecks, every unit test passes, and the
// panel renders perfectly for whichever context you happen to open first.
//
// ## The rule
//
// If a component seeds state from a prop, its call sites must either pass
// `key`, or be listed in [`KEYED_ELSEWHERE`] with the reason. There is one
// legitimate reason today: `Table` renders per-row editors under `rowKey`, so
// the key is already on the row.
//
// Source-level, because the alternative is a DOM and a render loop to catch a
// bug whose whole nature is that it looks fine on first render.
