// What the console hides, and what it must not hide by accident.
//
// The table under test is a hand-copied one — the agent does not serve the
// claim-type registry yet — so the failure it is most exposed to is not a wrong
// algorithm but a wrong transcription: an entry copied with the wrong
// sensitivity hides nothing, and one copied under the wrong token hides
// everything. These pin the entries where getting it wrong costs something, and
// the two rules around them: the conservative default for a token nobody has
// classified, and the refusal to reveal a value the mask was meant to cover.
//
// None of this is a security control. The value has already been fetched into
// the page by the time any of it runs, and `claim-sensitivity.ts` says so at
// length. These tests assert what is *drawn*.
