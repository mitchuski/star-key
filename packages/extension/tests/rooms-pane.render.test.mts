// needs to know WHICH of two unrelated failures they are looking at.**
//
// `epoch` behind the room's own means a commit was not delivered. `earliest`
// equal to `epoch` means the epoch key chain has not arrived. The repairs are
// different, and a pane that renders both as "you can't read this" tells a
// member their history was lost when it is sitting on a host waiting to be
// fetched. So each of the three standings is asserted against the words on
// screen rather than against `standing()`, which is a pure function and would
// pass while the pane drew none of it.
//
// The second thing asserted here is a refusal: this list is key custody, and
// the pane must never present it as membership or as permission to write.
