// Editors open where you clicked — the regression this redesign exists for.
//
// The bug, in the live console: pressing "+ Add an attribute" on the identity
// map appeared to do nothing. The form *was* rendered — at the very end of the
// JSX, after the attributes band, the faces, the divider, the contexts and the
// selection strip, which on a populated wallet is roughly 1700px down a 2450px
// scroller whose `scrollTop` never moved. Focus stayed on the button. Every
// visible signal said the click was ignored.
//
// A layout assertion cannot catch that here — happy-dom has no layout, so every
// box measures zero and any coordinate check would pass against the broken
// version too. So these assert the three things that are true of a popover and
// false of a form appended to the page, none of which need a layout engine:
//
//   1. it is a `dialog`, mounted as an overlay rather than as the last band
//   2. focus MOVES INTO it — the keyboard half of "nothing happened"
//   3. Escape closes it and gives focus back to the control that opened it
//
// Together those are what "it opened where I clicked" decomposes into for
// anything that is not a screenshot.
