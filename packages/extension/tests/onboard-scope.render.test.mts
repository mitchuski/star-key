// The setup flow's two questions, mounted.
//
// Every assertion here is about something a person would see and a type
// checker would not: which question is on screen at which point, what the
// message the wallet sends actually carries, and what ends up stored about the
// wallet's own authority.
//
// The order-dependence is the reason this is a rendered test rather than a
// unit one. The home context has to be known *before* the grant command for a
// context-scoped wallet (the command carries `--contexts`) and *after* it for
// an unrestricted one (the command names no context, and the picker reads the
// agent's real list as the now-granted ephemeral). That is two different
// screens for one field, and nothing below the component knows it.
//
// `chrome` is installed before the dynamic import on purpose: `store.ts`
// creates its zustand-persist store at module scope, which reaches
// `chrome.storage.local` on the way in. A static import would run that first
// and throw.
