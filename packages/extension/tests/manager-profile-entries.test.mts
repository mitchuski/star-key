// What a profile presents after an edit.
//
// The console's profile editor can express one of the four entry forms — a live
// reference — and has to carry the other three through an edit without changing
// what they say. Both failure modes are silent: the profile saves, keeps its
// name, keeps working, and presents a different set of claims than the operator
// ticked. Nothing surfaces until a disclosure.
//
// So the composition is a pure function and this file is the thing that tests
// it. Every assertion here has a paired positive: "the pinned entry survives"
// is worthless next to a composer that returns its input, and "the ticks are
// written" is worthless next to one that writes everything.
