// A refusal keeps its machine-readable half all the way to the console.
//
// The wallet's bridge used to collapse every rejection to a sentence — each
// handler wrote `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)`, and the console's
// `interpretOutcome` re-wrapped that string in a fresh `Error`. The agent's
// stable code and its structured details were gone by the time a pane saw the
// failure, so a pane that wanted to *act* on one particular refusal had one
// option left: matching on the message text. R3.7 forbids exactly that, because
// the agent may reword a message whenever it likes and may not change a code.
//
// The case that forced it: deleting a persona profile while personas are still
// bound to it is refused with an extended code and a `details.personaDids`
// naming them. The console could render neither — not the reason, not the list.
//
// Two things are pinned here and they pull in opposite directions:
//
//  1. The **console** path (`RUNTIME_MANAGER_TASK`) carries `code` and
//     `details` end to end, through a serializing message channel, and arrives
//     as a typed throw a pane can narrow on.
//  2. The **page** path (`RUNTIME_REQUEST_TASK`) does not. It shares the
//     offscreen handler, so the narrowing is a deliberate act in
//     `handleRequestTask` rather than something the shapes do for us — and a
//     deliberate act is the kind that gets undone by a passing refactor.
//
// Every negative assertion below is paired with a positive one. A test that
// only checks something is absent passes just as happily against an
// implementation that returns nothing at all, and this repo has been bitten by
// that shape of test before.
