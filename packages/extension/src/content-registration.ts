// Register the page provider only where the user has granted access.
//
// The manifest used to declare `content_scripts` matching `<all_urls>`, which
// meant two things: the provider was injected into every page the user ever
// visited, and Chrome's install prompt said "read and change all your data on
// all websites". Making *host permissions* optional (host-permissions.ts) did
// not change either, because a static content-script match is its own grant.
//
// So the match list moves out of the manifest and becomes derived state:
// whatever origins the user has granted, that is where the provider runs.
// Grant an origin and it appears; revoke it and it stops.
//
// Two consequences worth knowing:
//
//  - `registerContentScripts` needs host permission for the patterns it
//    registers, so this can only ever widen to what the user already allowed.
//    That is the point, but it also means the call must be re-run whenever
//    permissions change, or a fresh grant silently does nothing.
//  - Registration does not reach into tabs that are already open. A page
//    loaded before the grant has no provider until it reloads, which is why
//    the caller reloads the tab after granting.
