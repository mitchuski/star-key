// Why a transport failed — turning `TypeError: Failed to fetch` into
// something a person can act on.
//
// The problem this solves
// -----------------------
// When a mediator refuses the extension's origin, the browser blocks the
// request and hands JavaScript a bare `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. The
// reason — "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
// No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present" — goes to the devtools
// console and **nowhere else**. There is no API that returns it: the fetch
// spec deliberately makes a CORS failure opaque to the page so a script
// cannot use cross-origin errors to probe a network it has no access to. An
// extension cannot read its own console either.
//
// So the reason can never be recovered from the exception. It has to be
// *inferred*, and the inference is cheap:
//
//   - a request that fails at the network layer, against a host that answers
//     an opaque (`no-cors`) request a moment later, was refused by browser
//     policy, not by the network;
//   - a host that answers neither is unreachable.
//
// That single bit separates "your mediator is down" from "your mediator will
// not talk to this extension", which is the entire distinction an operator
// needs and the one the raw error destroys.
//
// Discriminating the error
// ------------------------
// R3.7 says match on stable machine-readable codes, never on strings, and
// nothing here matches a message. `TypeError` is the platform's own structural
// signal for "the fetch never produced a response" (network failure, CORS
// refusal, DNS, blocked scheme); `DOMException.name === "TimeoutError"` is the
// abort from `withFetchTimeout`. Anything else means the mediator *answered*
// and the failure came from its reply, which is a different class entirely and
// keeps its original message.
//
// Known limitation, deliberately accepted: the probe proves the host is up,
// not that CORS specifically refused us. A request that failed for an
// unrelated transient reason against a healthy host reads as
// `originNotAllowed`. The wording of `detail` therefore says what was
// observed rather than asserting a cause, and every remediation it suggests
// is safe to attempt if the guess is wrong.
