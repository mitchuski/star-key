// Wallet configuration, persisted in IndexedDB (shared across the service
// worker, offscreen doc, popup, and options page — all the same extension
// origin). IndexedDB rather than chrome.storage because the offscreen document
// — where DIDComm login + onboarding run — does NOT expose chrome.storage,
// while IndexedDB is available in every extension context (and is already the
// holder identity's backing store).
//
// An inbox is the relay an executor pushes to when it needs to reach this
// wallet, and there is one PER ONBOARDED AGENT — see `inboxes` below for why
// a single wallet-wide relay could only ever serve one agent. Each is written
// by onboarding from that agent's advertised DIDComm mediator, and overridden
// by hand only by an operator running more than one relay.
//
// It used to be described here as "baked into the holder's `did:peer:2`
// service endpoint at first mint, so changing it mints a NEW wallet DID".
// That stopped being true at the M2C migration: a v4 holder is a `did:key`
// the VTA mints (`store/holder-identity.ts`), and the mediator is nowhere
// inside it. Changing the inbox now means re-registering the address with
// whoever routes to you — not a new identity.

 * Which inbox to persist after onboarding at an agent.

 * wrong at a call site:
 *
 *  - Nothing advertised → write nothing. An agent that publishes no DIDComm
 *    mediator cannot push to a wallet; an inbox invented here would be a
 *    relay nobody was ever asked about. Unset is the honest state and the
 *    self-test reports it.
 *  - Set, and someone is on record choosing it → leave it here. An operator
 *    pin is final; an `agent`-sourced one is not frozen either, but moving it
 *    is the job of `followAgentInbox` in `background.ts`, which re-resolves
 *    the agent's DID document rather than guessing from a cached connection.
 *    This function only ever fills a blank.
 *  - Otherwise → adopt the agent's. That covers an unset inbox and, once, the
 *    records written before provenance existed.
 *
 * **Why `source` had to exist.** The first cut of this keyed on "is anything
 * set?", which read as sufficient and was not. `setSettings` merged the
 * *defaulted* view of the settings and wrote it back, so under the old
 * hardcoded default any unrelated write — turning on the passkey lock,
 * toggling TSP preference — persisted the demo mediator DID into IndexedDB as
 * though it had been chosen. Wallets therefore carry a stored inbox nobody
 * picked, indistinguishable by value from a deliberate one, and the migration
 * that was supposed to rescue them declined to touch it. (That write-back is
 * fixed in `setSettings` below; this handles the records it already made.)
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: an operator who hand-set a mediator
 * before provenance existed has it adopted over, once. With nothing deployed
 * and the alternative being wallets stuck on a relay in someone else's
 * deployment, that is the right side to err on — and the person affected is
 * exactly the person who knows how to set it again.
