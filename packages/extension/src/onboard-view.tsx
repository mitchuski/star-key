// VTA onboarding — the multi-step provisioning flow.
//
// Lifted out of popup.tsx so it can run in a full tab. It was not merely
// cramped there: Chrome tears down the action popup when a native dialog takes
// focus (crbug 40721470), and this flow raises two of them — the
// host-permission grant and the WebAuthn PRF ceremony. A tab is immune to that
// teardown, which is the whole reason for the move.
//
// ## The two questions this asks, and why they are two
//
// **What will this wallet do here** decides the ACL entry the agent writes:
// `"context"` — a party inside one context — or `"unrestricted"`, the shape an
// ACL reads as a super-admin, which is what the management console needs to
// administer the agent at all.
//
// **Where does it keep its settings** decides the context the admin DID is
// minted in and the wallet's own configuration lives in. It is asked in *both*
// cases, and that is the point: an unrestricted wallet reaches every context
// and still keeps its state in exactly one. Expressing scope by leaving the
// context blank would have left the console with nowhere to put it.
//
// Neither is a preference the wallet can infer. The agent used to be allowed
// to pick the context (`payload.context` omitted, inference rules run) and its
// reply did not have to say which it picked, so a wallet could finish
// onboarding without knowing where its own configuration had landed. Both are
// now always named, which also makes `provision/integration:contextRequired`
// unreachable — inference never runs — and the picker that used to recover
// from it is gone rather than kept for a case that cannot arise.
//
// ## Why the order differs between the two
//
// The grant command has to match the scope, and only the operator can run it:
//
//   * `"unrestricted"` → `pnm acl create … --role admin` with **no**
//     `--contexts`. The command needs no context, so the home context is
//     chosen *after* the grant, from the list the now-authorised ephemeral can
//     actually read (`vta/contexts/list`). A picker of real contexts beats a
//     slug typed from memory.
//   * `"context"` → the command carries `--contexts <id>`, so the context has
//     to be known *before* it is printed. It is asked as a text field, which
//     is not a downgrade: the operator is about to type the same string into
//     their own terminal.
//
// The provisioning sequence itself is otherwise unchanged.
