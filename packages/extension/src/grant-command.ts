// The `pnm acl create` line the operator runs to authorise this wallet.
//
// Its own module, and a `.ts` one, because what it prints is a security
// decision wearing the clothes of a display string. The command grants the
// ephemeral did:key whatever authority the wallet is about to inherit, and the
// two ways it can be wrong are both silent:
//
//   * **Too wide.** Omit `--contexts` and the grant is a *super-admin* — an
//     admin with an empty context list is unrestricted, which is the entire
//     mechanism (`vti-common`'s `act_scope`). The wallet asked to work inside
//     one context and the operator handed it the agent. Nothing on screen says
//     so, because a successful grant looks identical either way.
//   * **Too narrow.** Pass `--contexts` when the wallet asked for the whole
//     agent and the ephemeral cannot confer what it does not hold: the
//     provisioning is refused with `forbidden`, after the operator has run a
//     command they were told was correct.
//
// So the scope choice and the printed command are one decision, taken here,
// and tested.
//
// **There is no `--role super-admin`.** The CLI's roles are `admin`,
// `initiator`, `application` and `reader`; super-admin is the *shape* of an
// admin grant, not a role name. This used to print `--role super-admin` when
// the operator asked to create a context inline — a command `pnm` rejects
// outright — which is the concrete version of why this lives in a tested
// module.
//
// **`persona-holder` is named, because no role carries it.** The holder's own
// identity — the attribute pool, the faces over it, the disclosure history —
// sits above every trust context, and since verifiable-trust-infrastructure
// #1673 the agent admits a caller to it only on an ACL entry granted the
// capability *by name*: not a context admin, and not a super-admin either. A
// grant that omits it provisions a wallet whose console persona pane is
// refused on every task, and nothing at grant time says so. `--capabilities`
// on `pnm acl create` is a narrowing for every other name, but `persona-holder`
// is *additive* — it widens the role's set rather than replacing it — and the
// VTA carries it across the hand-off rollover to the long-term admin (#1573).
// Only an unscoped operator may confer it, which is why it moves
// {@link needsSuperAdminOperator}.
