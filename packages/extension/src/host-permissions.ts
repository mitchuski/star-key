// Just-in-time host permissions.
//
// The manifest asks for `optional_host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]`, not
// `host_permissions`. Nothing is granted at install time; the user grants a
// specific origin at the moment the wallet first needs it. Two reasons:
//
//  - A blanket `<all_urls>` grant means the wallet can reach every site the
//    user visits, forever, and `window.vtaWallet` appears on all of them.
//    Per-origin grants keep both to sites the user named.
//  - `<all_urls>` in `host_permissions` is a documented cause of extended
//    Chrome Web Store review; a reviewer has to rule out data harvesting
//    across the entire web before approving.
//
// Why this doesn't break the rest of the wallet
// ---------------------------------------------
// Only one egress path actually needs a host grant:
//
//  - **VTA REST** — vta-service applies an origin allowlist CORS layer
//    (`AllowOrigin::list`), so an ungranted fetch is CORS-blocked. Granted at
//    onboarding, where the host is derivable from the VTA `did:webvh` before
//    any request is made.
//
// (There used to be a second: cookie injection, which `chrome.cookies.set`
// hard-requires. That path and the `cookies` permission are gone — the wallet
// writes nothing to the cookie jar.)
//
// The other two do not:
//
//  - **DID resolution** — the did:webvh hosting service serves public
//    resolution with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so arbitrary RP DIDs
//    still resolve with no grant at all. This matters: `verifyDid` backs the
//    consent prompt's "does this RP resolve" check, there is no user gesture
//    available mid-consent to request a permission from, and a security
//    control that silently degrades is worse than one that isn't there.
//    A did:webvh host behind a restrictive CORS policy is the known gap —
//    it surfaces as "unresolved" in the prompt, which fails closed.
//    Because no grant stands in the way, the host a did:webvh names is
//    judged in core before anything is fetched: local-only names and
//    non-public addresses are refused (`core/src/did/egress-guard.ts`) and
//    surface the same way.
//  - **Mediator** — but only half of it, and the half that is exempt is not
//    the half that fails. The WebSocket upgrade is not subject to CORS; the
//    authentication handshake that must precede it is two ordinary `fetch`
//    calls (`POST {authEndpoint}/challenge`, then the packed response), and
//    those are cross-origin like any other. A mediator whose
//    `[security] cors_allow_origin` does not carry this extension's origin
//    blocks them, and TSP and DIDComm both drop out — they share that
//    handshake — leaving REST carrying everything and the inbox dark.
//
//    A host grant is deliberately still NOT requested for it, because it
//    would not be a fix: the mediator applies the same origin policy to the
//    WebSocket upgrade itself (server side, where no browser permission
//    reaches), so an origin it refuses stays refused. The fix is the
//    mediator's config, and `transport-diagnosis.ts` exists to say so instead
//    of leaving a bare "Failed to fetch" for someone to guess at.
//
// Gesture constraint
// ------------------
// `chrome.permissions.request` only works from a UI context (popup, options)
// inside a user gesture; it throws in a service worker. So the background
// *checks* and reports `HOST_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` with the origin, and the
// popup does the asking inside the click handler and retries. Matching on
// that code rather than on message text is guide rule R3.7.

/**
 * Stable code returned by background handlers when an operation needs a host
 * grant the user has not made. Matched on directly — never parse the message
 * (R3.7).

 * granted it or already had it.
 *
 * Two Chrome behaviours shape this, and getting either wrong makes the first
 * click appear to do nothing:
 *
 *  1. **`chrome.permissions.request` must be reached with the user gesture
 *     still live.** Any `await` before it spends the gesture — including an
 *     innocent-looking `permissions.contains` pre-check, which is why there
 *     isn't one here. Requesting a permission the user already holds
 *     resolves true immediately without showing a dialog, so the pre-check
 *     bought nothing anyway.
 *
 *  2. **The returned promise may never settle.** Showing the dialog can tear
 *     down the calling action popup (crbug 40721470); the context is
 *     destroyed mid-await and nothing after it runs. `permissions.onAdded`
 *     fires on the grant itself, so racing the two means a surviving popup
 *     continues the moment the user clicks Allow rather than hanging on a
 *     promise that will never resolve.
 *
 * A popup that Chrome *does* destroy is beyond rescue from in here — the
 * caller persists enough state to resume when it reopens.
