/**
 * The generic page → VTA task relay.
 *
 * The page proposes a type URI and a payload. That is all it proposes: the
 * envelope is minted in the offscreen, inside the device's trust boundary, and
 * stamped with the browser-attested origin. The wallet never counter-signs a
 * document the page wrote.
 *
 * ## Why this prompts every time, and offers no "remember"
 *
 * `gatedConsent` would be the obvious choice, and it is the wrong one. It
 * short-circuits on origin trust — and origin trust is not capability trust.
 *
 * Under a per-method surface, a "remember this site" tick meant "this site may
 * call `vaultList()` and `proxyLogin()`", because those were the only things it
 * could call. Under a *generic* relay it would mean "this site may ask my agent
 * to do anything at all", and a tick made once on a `vaultList()` prompt would
 * silently authorize a DID deactivation a year later. The set of things the
 * grant covers grew, without the user ever being asked about the new members.
 *
 * The VTA's policy engine is the real authority here, and when its `requireConsent`
 * fires, the approver gets a properly informed prompt showing what the task will
 * actually do. But `config.policy.enforcement` is **opt-in and defaults to off** —
 * so on a default deployment this prompt is the only thing standing between an
 * arbitrary page and an arbitrary task. It does not get to be skippable.
 *
 * The right long-term answer is scoped grants — `(origin, subject, typeGlob,
 * expiry)`, rememberable only for tasks the VTA classifies `sideEffects: none`.
 * Until those exist, ask.

 * an extension page the operator opened themselves, and there is no origin to

 * clicks through twelve identical dialogs to see a page is not consenting to
 * anything, they are dismissing an obstacle.
 *
 * What still stands between the console and a destructive change: the agent's
 * own policy engine, which answers `requireConsent` as a `consentRequired`
 * outcome that the console renders as an approval ceremony rather than an
 * error; the agent's ACL, which is the only authority that decides whether this
 * caller may act at all; and the console's own preview-then-confirm on every
 * irreversible action, which shows the agent's account of what would be
 * destroyed rather than a generic "are you sure".
