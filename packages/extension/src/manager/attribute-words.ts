// The words an attribute is described by, wherever it is drawn.
//
// These were private to `persona-map.tsx` while the map was the only surface
// that drew an attribute. The list view draws the same attributes in a
// different shape, and a second copy of `provenanceWords` is how the map comes
// to say *you said so* beside a row the list calls *credential · storm.ws* —
// the same defect as two groupings of one pool that disagree, in the channel a
// person is most likely to act on.
//
// So they moved down rather than being copied across, and they take no props
// and touch no DOM: every one of them is a claim about an attribute, testable
// as a string. The rule they all follow is `design-docs/persona-vocabulary.md`
// — *you said so*, *credential · ‹issuer›*, *made per verifier*, *stale ·
// ‹reason›* — which is the other reason to have exactly one of each. A word
// retired from that table has to be findable, and it is findable here.
