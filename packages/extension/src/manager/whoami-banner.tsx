 *
 * **Switching reloads the page**, deliberately. Thirteen panes each hold their
 * own fetched state, and propagating a change of agent through all of them is
 * thirteen chances to leave one holding the previous agent's keys, credentials
 * or ACL under the new agent's name in the header. That is not a stale-data
 * annoyance — it is the console telling the operator something false about who
 * they are administering, on the surface whose whole job is to answer that. A
 * reload is provably clean and costs a second.
