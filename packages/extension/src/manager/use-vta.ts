// Which agent this console is administering, and what it may do there.
//
// Two separate questions, deliberately answered by two different places:
//
//  - **Which agent** comes from `chrome.storage.local` (`active-vta.ts`), the
//    same connection record the popup and background read. The console does not
//    get its own notion of "the active VTA"; a second one would drift.
//
//  - **What this caller may do** comes from the agent itself, via `whoAmI`, and
//    is never inferred from anything stored locally. That is the whole point of
//    the task: it re-resolves roles and scopes at call time rather than reading
//    them out of an access token, so a role granted or revoked since the token
//    was minted shows up immediately. A console that cached authority would
//    show an operator buttons they can no longer use, and — worse — hide ones
//    they just gained.
