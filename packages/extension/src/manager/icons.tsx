// The console's icon set.
//
// One 24×24 grid, 1.6 stroke, round caps and joins, `currentColor` throughout,
// so an icon inherits whatever colour the thing it sits in already resolved —
// an act's hue on the rail, a family's hue on a group header, a standing's hue
// on a context card. Nothing here hardcodes a colour, for the same reason
// `theme.ts` hardcodes none: a literal would be right in exactly one theme.
//
// ## Why these glyphs and not a generic set
//
// The four sections under "Authority & graph" are the reason this file is
// hand-drawn. Access, Approvals, Policy and Sessions are all *security*, so any
// four shield-and-padlock variants collapse into each other at 18px — which is
// the size they are actually rendered at. They are drawn instead as four
// different **kinds of thing**, sharing no motif:
//
//   Access     a person beside a list — an ACL is literally who may act
//   Approvals  a check in a circle — a decision
//   Policy     a fork — rules that route
//   Sessions   a clock — live, and expiring
//
// Two more worth recording, because the obvious drawing was wrong:
//
//   Rooms      a vault, not a door. A door outline is an empty rectangle at
//              18px, indistinguishable from `app-state`'s panel — and a room
//              is shared storage whose host holds ciphertext it cannot read,
//              which a vault says and a door does not.
//   DIDs       a tag. An identifier that resolves, rather than a document.
//
// ## Standing is a shape, not only a colour
//
// `st-known` / `st-identified` / `st-absent` differ in **form** — filled,
// dashed, struck through — before they differ in hue. A context's standing is
// the one thing on the identity map a reader must not get wrong, and
// `identified` in particular is a real state that used to have no words on
// screen at all (see CLAUDE.md). A reader who cannot separate green from amber
// still reads three different shapes.
