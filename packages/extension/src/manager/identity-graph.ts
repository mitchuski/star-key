// The identity map's model: attributes, faces, contexts, and what reaches what.
//
// The persona pane draws one picture of the whole model — attributes on top, faces
// in the middle, contexts below — and lights up everything a selection reaches.
// Which things light up is the substance of the picture: an attribute that reaches
// two contexts through one face is the holder's linkage made visible, and a
// context that lights the wrong face is a lie about what it holds. So the graph
// and the reach computation live here, out of the component, with no DOM and
// no relative imports, where they can be tested the way `profile-entries.ts`
// was.
//
// Vocabulary on screen follows `design-docs/persona-vocabulary.md`: an attribute, a
// face, a context, a persona that *wears* a face. The identifiers below keep the
// spec's names where they name wire records (`profileId`, `personaDid`).
