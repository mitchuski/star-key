// Preview-then-confirm, and the consent ceremony that can interrupt it.
//
// ## Why the preview comes from the agent
//
// A generic "Are you sure?" is worth nothing: the operator already believes
// they are sure, and the dialog adds a click rather than information. What
// changes a decision is *what would actually be destroyed*, and only the agent
// knows that — `contextPreviewDelete` returns the real keys and DIDs a context
// holds, which is precisely the list an operator does not have in their head.
//
// So every irreversible action here is two calls: ask the agent what the change
// would cost, render its answer verbatim, then send the change. `force` is a
// separate explicit tick rather than something the confirm button implies,
// because the agent refuses a non-empty deletion on purpose and overriding that
// refusal is a second decision.
//
// ## `nature`, and why a second component was not written
//
// Not every two-step action is a destruction. Realigning a DID's key records
// asks the agent for the same thing — what would change, before it changes —
// and then applies it, but nothing is lost: records are renamed and the key
// material behind them is untouched.
//
// Drawing that in red would be a lie of exactly the kind `manager-theme.css`
// forbids, where `--w-danger` is one of three colours that mean something. So
// the *shape* of the decision is shared and the **voice** is a parameter:
// `nature: "corrective"` asks what would change rather than what would be
// destroyed, and draws in the accent rather than in danger. It gets no `force`
// tick, because there is no refusal to override.
//
// ## Why `consentRequired` renders here
//
// The agent may answer "a human must approve this first". That is not a
// failure — the refusal carries the salted payload digest whose prefix the
// operator matches on their approving device. Rendering it as a red error would
// discard the informed-consent ceremony at the exact moment the human was meant
// to act, so it gets the same surface as the preview: this is the one place the
// console catches `ConsentRequiredError`.
