// The list view's model: attributes in groups, a selection over them, and what
// a bulk action would do.
//
// ## Why a second view at all
//
// The identity map answers "what reaches what". It is the right picture for a
// pool of five and the wrong one for a pool of fifty: reach is drawn per
// selection, so a holder who wants to *tidy* — delete four stale numbers, put
// six attributes into a new face — has to open, read and confirm one card at a
// time. That is the clunkiness the map cannot design its way out of, because
// the map's whole subject is one selection at a time.
//
// So this module is the model for a second view over the same graph: the same
// `AttributeNode`s, the same families, no new wire records, and a selection
// that is a *set* rather than a single node. It lives out of the component for
// the same reason `identity-graph.ts` does — the interesting parts are the
// ordering and the set arithmetic, and both are testable with no DOM.
//
// ## The grouping is the one that already exists
//
// Rows group by `familyOf`, in `FAMILY_ORDER`, with `familyStyle`'s words as
// the headings. Not a second taxonomy invented for this view: two groupings of
// the same pool that disagree is the defect where a person counts six in one
// place and five in the other and neither is wrong. If the list wants a
// grouping the map does not have, it belongs in `attribute-family.ts` where
// both read it.
//
// ## One bulk action is deliberately missing
//
// `persona/attribute/put` is a **replace**, and this console lists without
// `includeSensitive` on purpose — so an attribute resolving to `sensitivity:
// high` reaches the client with `value: undefined`. A bulk "change visibility
// on these twelve" written through `put` would send `value: ""` for every
// sensitive one and blank it, silently, with no `attribute/get` and no version
// history to restore from. That is the same hazard `AttributeEditor` fetches a
// value to avoid, multiplied by the size of the selection.
//
// So {@link BULK_ACTIONS} has two members and not three, and
// {@link whyNoBulkVisibility} exists so the screen can *say* why rather than
// leaving a gap someone fills in later. Visibility stays a one-at-a-time edit
// through the editor that holds the value.
