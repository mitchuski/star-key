// The identity map — one picture of attributes, faces and contexts.
//
// Three bands, top to bottom: the attributes you hold, the faces that select among
// them, the contexts where a persona wears one. Between the second and third
// runs the line the whole family is built around, drawn rather than described:
// copies go down, nothing reads up.
//
// Select anything and everything it reaches lights up — see `reachOf` in
// `identity-graph.ts` for what "reaches" means in each direction, and why a
// attribute's reach is where it *goes* while a context's is what it *holds*. The
// two red arrows from one face to two personas ARE a link: every wearer shows
// the same values, so anyone who sees two of them knows they are one person.
// That is shown where it happens, not reported at the bottom.
//
// The edges are drawn in an SVG laid over the bands, from card positions the
// component measures after layout. That is the only reason this file touches
// the DOM directly; the model it draws is computed in `identity-graph.ts`, with
// tests, and nothing here decides what connects to what.
