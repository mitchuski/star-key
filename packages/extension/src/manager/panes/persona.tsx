// Persona — the holder's own identity, and the one pane in this console that
// sits ABOVE every trust context.
//
// ## What this pane is for
//
// Everywhere else in the console, a context is the compartment: keys, DIDs,
// memory and app-state all live inside one. The attribute pool and the profiles
// over it do not. There is one person here, with one set of attributes about
// themselves, and the contexts are the places they choose to be known.
//
// So the pane is a picture rather than a filtered list — the identity map in
// `persona-map.tsx`: attributes on top, faces in the middle, contexts below, with the
// one-way line drawn between. And for the holder who has nothing yet, the
// guided setup in `persona-setup.tsx`: an attribute, a face, a context, in the order
// the model runs. This file loads what both need and decides which to show.
//
// ## The boundary runs through the middle of it
//
// Every task on this page is holder-scoped: the agent gates them on the
// `persona-holder` capability, granted by name, and refuses every role without
// it — a context-scoped administrator, and an unrestricted one too (#1673).
// That is why `holdsPersonaHolder` and not `hasRole(authority, "admin")`.
//
// The one call that crosses the boundary is `personaBindingSet`, and it crosses
// **downwards**: the agent resolves the profile up here and pushes a
// materialised copy of the values into the context. The context receives
// claims, never a reference, so nothing inside it can address the pool
// afterwards. Nothing on this page reads upwards out of a context, and there is
// no task that would let it.
//
// ## Why the console, and not the wallet
//
// The wallet half of `persona/*` ships in `@openvtc/pnm-core/persona` and is
// deliberately the context-scoped half only. The console holds the credential
// that can author a persona — it administers the agent rather than acting as
// one inside it — which is what makes this pane possible at all, and why the CI
// guard on those ten URIs names `manager.js` as its single exception rather
// than banning them outright.
//
// ## Words
//
// On screen: an attribute, a face, a context, a persona that wears a face. See
// `design-docs/persona-vocabulary.md`. In code the spec's names stay where they
// name wire records.
