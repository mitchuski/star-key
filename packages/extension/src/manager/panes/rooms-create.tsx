// Making a room: a context, its host, the room's own identity, what the host sees.
//
// **A room is a DID, not a row in a host's table.** The room's own identity
// issues the credentials that govern it, and a host authorises every operation
// against those credentials rather than against anything it stores — so the
// room is portable. Re-point it at another host and the room has moved, with no
// credential reissued and nothing to migrate.
//
// ## One context, and two kinds of DID in it
//
// The host and its rooms — one host, many rooms — live in one context, and what
// keeps them apart is which DID is the **context's own** (`ctx.did`):
//
// - **The host is the context's DID.** A room-host enrolled into a context
//   fetches that context's DID and keys from the agent (`vta/contexts/secrets`)
//   and serves as it. So "which DID will the host be" has exactly one answer,
//   and step 2 is about making it the right one: use the one the context has,
//   make another of its DIDs the context's (`vta/contexts/update-did`), mint one
//   with `setPrimary: true`, or name a host run elsewhere.
// - **Every room is a DID beside it**, minted with `setPrimary: false`.
//
// That `false` is load-bearing and was missing. `dids/create` defaults it to
// `true` and overwrites whatever the context acted as, so every room this form
// minted before it became its context's DID — and a host enrolled there would
// have come up serving *as the room*. Nothing on the screen or the wire looked
// wrong when it happened.
//
// Sharing a context does not hand the host a room's keys. The host's grant is
// `application`; exporting a key needs admin, `contexts/secrets` releases only
// the context DID's keys, and `keys/sign` at `application` signs under an opaque
// domain that verifies as nothing but an opaque-signing payload — not as a proof
// on a room's credential.
//
// ## A new host is a step you finish
//
// Minting a host's DID is not having a host. room-host has to be started,
// enrolled, granted and restarted before a room can be registered with it, and
// registration is the first thing that would notice otherwise — as an opaque
// internal error from the agent. So after minting, the form prints what to run,
// and holds the later steps closed until the operator says the host is running.
// That is their confirmation, not a check, and the form says so.
//
// ## The host needs a URL, today
//
// `vta-service` can only initiate a call to a host over REST (`OUTBOUND_SUPPORTED`
// in its `operations/room_host.rs`), so a host with no URL cannot be registered.
// The mediator is for members: room-host started with `--mediator-did` serves
// DIDComm and TSP there. The templates publish the mediator for DIDComm; each
// mint here can add a `TSPTransport` entry at the same mediator with
// `addTspService`, which the agent applies to a template-rendered document
// (verifiable-trust-infrastructure, alongside this change — before it, the flag
// was accepted and silently dropped for every templated DID). Off by default:
// for a host it is a claim that room-host will answer TSP at `--mediator-did`;
// for a room, nothing answers as the room's DID over either protocol yet, and
// the words beside the box say so.
//
// ## Screen order and wire order
//
// The screen asks for the host before the room; the wire still mints the room's
// identity before any host is told about it. A room whose name came from its
// host is a room that cannot leave.
//
// ## The pair, and the failure that matters
//
// Every `rooms/owner/*` task needs the room's DID **and** the identifier of the
// key that signs as it. This agent names a minted DID's signing key
// `{did}#key-0`, so an existing room's keys are offered from the context's key
// records by that prefix — a convention of this agent rather than a contract,
// which is why typing one stays possible.
//
// **The key record's id and the DID document's verification method are not the
// same string for a templated mint, and here they disagree by one.** The `room`
// and `room-host` built-in templates (`vta-sdk/templates/`) number their
// verification methods `#key-1` (signing) and `#key-2` (key agreement), while
// the create path saves the key records as `#key-0` and `#key-1` — so the
// document's `#key-1` names the signing key and the keystore's names the
// x25519 one. The public keys still line up positionally, which is why a room
// credential (the VTA signs it naming `{room_did}#key-1`, matching the
// template) verifies; what does not survive is *addressing a key by the id the
// document publishes*. Hence the filter below: the offer is by prefix and
// `keyType !== "x25519"`, never by fragment number. Reported upstream.
//
// Minting can succeed and registration fail. The DID is real and the key
// identifier is the half nobody writes down, so `Minted` keeps both on screen
// and the flow switches to the existing-identity path pre-filled: the retry
// registers that room rather than minting a second one.
