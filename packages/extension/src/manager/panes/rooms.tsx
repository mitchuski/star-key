// Data rooms — shared spaces this agent holds keys for.
//
// A room is a set of records governed by credentials the *room itself* issued,
// not by anything its host stores. Two consequences shape this pane and neither
// is obvious from the screen:
//
// **This list is key custody, not membership.** It answers "what can this VTA
// open", which is a different set from "what is its principal a member of". A
// room whose Welcome never arrived is absent even where a perfectly good
// membership credential is held; a VTA not yet told of a removal still lists a
// room it can read and can no longer write to. So the pane never presents this
// as authority — the host decides that, from credentials the room issued, and
// the honest failure is a refusal at the point of use.
//
// **Two epochs per room, because neither alone is enough.** `epoch` behind the
// room's own means a commit was not delivered and records written since will
// not open. `earliest` equal to `epoch` means the epoch key chain has not
// arrived, so history before joining is unreadable. Different repairs, and a
// member shown only "you can't read this" reads it as loss rather than as a
// delivery that has not happened. The pane says which it is.
//
// Reading a sealed record is two hops on purpose: the host serves ciphertext it
// cannot read, and the member's own VTA opens it. Nothing here ever holds a key.
