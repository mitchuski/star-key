// ## Why no `version` appears anywhere in this pane's tables
//
// The persona store keeps ONE MONOTONIC COUNTER FOR THE WHOLE STORE, and a
// record's `version` is the counter value its most recent write took. The
// schema says so outright: "a value of the store's monotonic write counter".
// It is an optimistic-concurrency token and a change-feed watermark at once —
// which per-record counters could not be, because two records' counters would
// not be comparable to each other.
//
// So it is **not an edit count**, and rendering it as `v2` beside a timestamp
// said that it was. Add a second attribute to an empty pool and it arrives as
// `v2` having never been edited: the console was reporting the pool's write
// history as the record's own. Same failure `format.ts` exists for — a value
// the console did not have, rendered as a confident wrong one — and worse here,
// because the number is plausible and nothing on screen distinguishes it from
// the revision count it looks like.
//
// The version is still read and still matters: every edit sends it back as
// `expectedVersion`, which is what an opaque concurrency token is for. It is a
// value to carry, not a value to show.

/**
 * Deleting a profile: the agent's refusal is the preview.
 *
 * Everything else irreversible in this console previews by asking the agent
 * what the change would cost. There is no read that answers it here — "which
 * personas present this profile" spans every context, and the only code that
 * computes it agent-side lives inside `persona/profile/delete` itself, where it
 * runs in order to *refuse*.
 *
 * So the refusal is the preview, and it is a better one than a question would
 * have been: it is computed at the moment of the delete rather than a moment
 * before it, so nothing can bind in between.
 *
 * **This shape needs the refusal's code and details to survive the bridge**,
 * which they did not until the relay was widened. Before that the console had
 * only prose, matching on which R3.7 forbids, so the unbind was offered up
 * front as a checkbox the operator had to reason about with no idea whether it
 * applied. Now the first attempt is the question and the answer names the
 * personas.
 *
 * `Destructive`'s force tick is still the wrong shape for this: it disables the
 * confirm until ticked, which would make every operator authorise an unbind for
 * the ordinary case where nothing is bound.

 * **A persona DID is not necessarily one of the context's published `did:webvh`
 * identifiers.** A v4 holder is a `did:key` the VTA mints, peers are reached at
 * `did:peer`, and a binding names whichever identifier this context knows the
 * holder by. A select would refuse every one of those — turning a convenience
 * into a constraint, and a wrong one.
 *
 * So the two sources are suggestions over a field that still takes anything:
 * the DIDs this context publishes, and the personas already known here (which
 * the first list does not contain when the persona is not a webvh DID — exactly
 * the case a picker built only from published DIDs would hide).

/**
 * Choosing which persona this context knows you by.
 *
 * **A dropdown, with a way out.** #165 made this a free-text field with a
 * `datalist`, on the reasoning that a persona DID need not be one of the
 * context's published `did:webvh` identifiers — a v4 holder is a `did:key` the
 * VTA mints, peers are `did:peer` — and a `<select>` would refuse all of those.
 * That reasoning still holds, and it was still the wrong control: in a context
 * publishing nothing the field is an empty box asking a first-time holder to
 * type a DID they do not have, which is where the guided setup dead-ended.
 *
 * So the list leads and the free-text field is one option inside it. The
 * unusual identifiers stay reachable; they stop being the default question.
 *
 * **And when a context has none, the answer is to make one**, not to send the
 * holder to another pane mid-flow. `serverId` is what that needs: omitting it
 * means *serverless* — the caller serves the log itself at a `url` — so this
 * asks the agent which hosting servers it can publish through and uses the one
 * when there is one. No server registered is the one case that really does
 * belong in the DIDs pane, and it says so.
