// DIDs — the `did:webvh` identifiers a context publishes.
//
// Scoped to the selected context like Keys, and for the same reason:
// `webvhDidList` takes a `contextId`, so a changed selection asks the agent a
// different question rather than filtering an answer it already gave.
//
// A DID here is a *published* identifier: its log lives on a hosting server and
// anyone can resolve it. That is why deletion is treated as the sharpest action
// in this console — see the confirm copy.
//
// A row opens into `did-detail.tsx`, which fetches the log. It is fetched on
// open rather than with the listing because `includeLog` is opt-in at the agent
// for a reason: the log is the DID's whole history and can be large, and a
// listing that pulled every one would be the whole history of every identifier
// to draw a table.
