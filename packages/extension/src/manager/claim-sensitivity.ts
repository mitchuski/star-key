// How carefully an attribute's value is shown to the person who owns it.
//
// ## This is not a security control, and saying so is the point
//
// By the time this module runs, the value is already in the page: the console
// asked `persona/attribute/list`, the agent answered, and the string sits in a
// React tree that any script on this origin — and every screenshot, screen
// share and shoulder — can reach. Masking it afterwards changes what is
// *drawn*, not what was *fetched*. Anyone reading this code and concluding that
// a masked card is a card whose value the console does not hold has read it
// wrong.
//
// What it does defend against is the whole of what it claims: someone standing
// behind the operator, a screen recording, a support call where the console is
// shared, a screenshot pasted into an issue. Those are real, and they are the
// entire scope.
//
// **The control that matters is the read path, and it now exists.**
// `includeSensitive` on `persona/attribute/list` (trust-tasks 0.17.4) is what
// keeps a sensitive value out of the page in the first place, and the persona
// pane lists *without* it: see `reveal-value.ts`, where *Show* becomes the
// request for one value rather than a curtain drawn back over a string that was
// already here. `CLAIM-TYPES.md` §3.1 says it in one sentence — "Masking a value
// already fetched is theatre. The control that matters is on the read path; the
// mask is what makes the control visible." This file is that visible half, and
// only that half. Do not describe it as anything more in a UI string, a commit
// message or a review.
//
// ## The table below is vendored, and will go stale
//
// Copied by hand from **`dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf/specs/persona/_shared/0.1/claim-types.json`**
// (`registryVersion` 0.1, draft/in review), because the agent does not serve
// this table: `CLAIM-TYPES.md` §6 lists a `persona/claim-types/list` task as an
// open question, deliberately deferred until the first extension type ships.
// Clients ship it statically in the meantime, and this is the static copy.
//
// Only the two members this console reads are transcribed — `sensitivity` and
// `mask`. The registry also carries `valueType`, `release`, `minimumSet` and
// `oidc` mappings; a vendored copy that reproduced all of them would look like
// a client that acts on all of them, and none of the others has a consumer
// here. Re-sync by comparing this table against that file, not by rewriting it
// from memory.

 * so `isSensitive` called it hidden and the strip promised it was "hidden until
 * you press Show", while the address sat on screen in full with no button to
 * press. Two functions, one question, two answers.

 * chose; absent means they chose nothing and the registry answers, which is why
 * this takes the override rather than a resolved value. The two are kept apart
 * all the way to the screen: `source` says which is speaking, so a pane can say
 * "you decided" instead of presenting the registry's answer as the holder's.
 *
 * **Only the axis the holder decided moves — with one exception, and it is the

 * separate statement it has made (§3.3: the axes are independent — an email is
 * worth hiding from the person behind you without being worth withholding from
 * every listing), so deciding sensitivity leaves it alone. A holder who marks
 * `phone.mobile` unsensitive gets the value delivered and still sees `•• 25`
 * until they press Show.
 *
 * For an **unregistered** token there is no such statement. `UNREGISTERED` is
 * one conservative answer standing in for a decision nobody made — §4 rule 3's
 * own reasoning, "a vocabulary the registry has never seen is exactly the one
 * nobody has reasoned about" — so when the holder decides, the thing it stood
 * in for has arrived and the mask follows their answer instead of the floor.
 * Without this, someone who marked their own `profile.github` as not sensitive
 * would still be shown four bullets and told to press a button, by a rule whose
 * only justification was that nobody had looked at it yet.
 *
 * The narrowness is the point: a *declared* token's mask never moves, because
 * there the registry has an opinion and this console does not overrule it.
