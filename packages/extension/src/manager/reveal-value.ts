// Asking the agent for one sensitive value, at the moment a person asks to see it.
//
// ## Why this exists at all
//
// `persona/attribute/list` answers a values request with the metadata of every
// attribute resolving to `sensitivity: high` and the plaintext of none, unless
// the caller also sets `includeSensitive`. The console never set it, so those
// values never arrived — and the pane masked the placeholder that stood in for
// them. A card read `••••` beside a *Show* button, pressing *Show* said "not on
// this page", and a strip underneath explained that the agent "has already sent
// this value here", which was the one thing that had not happened.
//
// The masking was not wrong so much as pointed at nothing. The specification is
// blunt about which half matters: "a consumer that masks a value it has already
// received defends a screen; it does not keep a card number out of a log, a
// crash dump or a process's memory. Ignoring this member and masking
// client-side is a conforming implementation of nothing."
//
// ## One value, on a press, and not a pool
//
// So the pane keeps listing without sensitive values, and *Show* becomes the
// request. Until it is pressed the plaintext is genuinely not in the page —
// which is what makes the mask a control rather than a curtain — and pressing
// it fetches exactly the one attribute a person is looking at.
//
// The obvious shortcut is to set `includeSensitive` on the pane's own listing.
// It is three lines, it makes every *Show* instant, and it puts every passport
// number and card number the holder owns into a React tree for as long as the
// tab is open, on the reasoning that they might press one of the buttons. That
// is the decorative version with extra steps.
//
// ## Narrowed by type, matched by id
//
// There is no `attribute/get` in the vocabulary — `list`, `put`, `delete` — so
// the narrowest question available is `typePrefix` set to the attribute's own
// type. That can return siblings (two `phone.mobile` entries), which is why the
// answer is matched on `attributeId` and never on position. A prefix is a byte
// comparison at the agent (SPEC: "the maintainer MUST NOT interpret the value
// further"), so passing a whole type is a legal, and the tightest, prefix.
