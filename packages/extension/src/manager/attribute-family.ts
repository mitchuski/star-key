// Which family an attribute's claim type belongs to, and the colour that says so.
//
// ## Why a family at all
//
// The identity map draws every attribute the holder keeps as one card in one
// row. At five cards that is a row; at thirty it is a wall, and a wall is where
// the answer to "what does this person actually keep about themselves" goes to
// hide. Grouping the row into families — who you are, how to reach you, what is
// already public, what your agent gates — restores the shape of the pool at a
// glance, and the colour is what carries that shape onto the face cards, where
// a composition can then be read without opening it.
//
// ## Colour here is categorical, and that distinction is the whole licence
//
// `manager-theme.css` sets the rule this module has to live inside: `--w-ok` /
// `--w-warn` / `--w-danger` are the only colours that *mean* something, and the
// act colours are navigation, never state. A family hue is the second kind. It
// says which vocabulary a token comes from and nothing about whether anything
// is wrong, which is why it is only ever a 3px stripe or a 6px dot — never a
// card border (selection and reach own that channel) and never a pill (status
// owns that one). Three channels, three meanings, no overlap.
//
// It is also never the only carrier: the type token itself is printed in mono
// on every card, and each group wears its family's words as a heading. Someone
// who cannot separate the hues loses nothing but the shortcut.
//
// ## Only what the registry declares gets classified
//
// `familyOf` reads the vendored claim-type table's roots and refuses to invent
// anything beyond them. A token the registry has never seen resolves to
// `unregistered` — not to a family guessed from its spelling — for the same
// reason `claim-sensitivity.ts` will not walk a prefix into a *looser*
// treatment: a local rule that groups `profile.github` under some invented
// "profile" family is a statement about a vocabulary nobody has agreed, drawn
// in a colour that reads as though somebody had. `unregistered` is an honest
// answer and its words on screen say so.
