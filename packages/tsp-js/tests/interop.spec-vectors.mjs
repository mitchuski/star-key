// ── The specification's own Appendix A test vectors ──
//
// Fixture extracted from Appendix A of the merged specification
// (trustoverip/tswg-tsp-specification f5b8668), which packs `YTSP-AAC`. It
// replaced the pre-merge `YTSP-ABA` vectors from spec commit 66a1580: the
// version is inside the signed envelope, the AAD and every SAID, so every
// message changed with it.
//
// These check something neither a round trip nor a two-implementation interop
// run can. A round trip passes whenever the encoder and decoder share a
// misreading, and an interop harness that packs with one implementation and
// unpacks with the other passes whenever *both* share one. These bytes are
// fixed, external, and were produced by neither of us.
//
// Three of the ten are exercised here and the three HPKE-Base control vectors in
// `control.spec-vectors.mjs`. `direct-sealed-box` and `control-rfi-sealed-box`
// need the libsodium sealed box (§8.3), which we deliberately do not implement;
// `direct-signed-only` is an unencrypted `-E` frame we never receive;
// `direct-hpke-base-pq` needs ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Each is skipped by
// name below rather than silently absent, so the list says what is missing
// instead of looking complete.
