// Which revision of the TSP specification framed this message.
//
// The whole dual-revision design rests on one property: **the revision is
// readable without any keys, at a fixed offset, before anything else is
// parsed.** A TSP message opens with the `-E` count code and then the version
// marker:
//
//   f8 40 13   -E count (short form, 3 bytes)   ← or `fb …` long form, 6 bytes
//   61 34 8f   YTSP genus marker
//   f8 00 01   version count code: MAJOR=0, MINOR=1  → Rev 2
//   f8 00 02   version count code: MAJOR=0, MINOR=2  → Rev 3
//
// So `peekRevision` reads at most nine bytes and never touches a key. That is
// what makes "receive both, pack one" honest rather than a guess: an inbound
// message *says* what it is, and we dispatch on what it says.
//
// ── Why the two MINOR values are not symmetric ──
//
// Rev 2 is the only MINOR we match exactly. Everything else at MAJOR 0 is read
// as Rev 3, because §9.1 makes MAJOR the field that gates processability and
// MINOR one that no implementation may refuse a message on — the ToIP reference
// discards MINOR entirely. Pre-merge drafts of Rev 3 shipped `YTSP-ABA`, which
// is MINOR 64 under this (MAJOR.MINOR) reading and MINOR 1 / PATCH 0 under the
// three-component one; the merged specification's Appendix A vectors, like
// affinidi-tsp and this package, carry `AAC` = 2. Both must parse as Rev 3,
// and so must whatever the resolution of that argument turns out to be, so
// enumerating known-good MINORs would be the wrong shape. See
// `KNOWN_MINORS` for what the list is actually for.
//
// ── What this is not ──
//
// This is not negotiation. We pack Rev 3 unconditionally; a Rev 2 peer cannot
// read what we send, and nothing here pretends otherwise. `peekRevision` exists
// so that a Rev 2 message we are *given* is read correctly and reported as
// such, rather than dying at the ciphertext selector with "missing F
// ciphertext field" — a crypto-layer error for a problem that is nothing of the
// sort.
