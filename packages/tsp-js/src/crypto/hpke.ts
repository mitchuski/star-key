// HPKE (RFC 9180) seal/open — the exact suite affinidi-tsp and the VTA
// sealed-transfer format both mandate: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256),
// HKDF-SHA256, ChaCha20Poly1305, single-shot.
//
// Two modes, one implementation:
//   - Auth mode (`seal`/`open`)          — TSP messages; the KEM also
//     authenticates the sender, so no separate signature is needed for it.
//   - Base mode (`sealBase`/`openBase`)  — VTA sealed bundles; the sender is
//     anonymous and authentication comes from the surrounding envelope.
//
// Implemented in pure TypeScript on the @noble primitives (`hpke-noble.ts`)
// so ONE code path runs identically in every JS runtime — browser, Node, and
// React Native, whose Hermes engine ships no `crypto.subtle` (and real apps
// polyfill it only partially, which is why runtime detection was dropped).
// hpke-js remains as a dev-dependency: the test suite holds this
// implementation byte-identical to it, in both modes, and to the official
// RFC 9180 vectors.
//
// The only runtime requirement is `crypto.getRandomValues` (native in
// browsers/Node; on React Native: `react-native-get-random-values`) — and
// only for sealing. Opening needs no randomness at all.
