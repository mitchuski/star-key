// TSP routed mode (§5.3) and nested mode (§5.5). TS port of affinidi-tsp
// `src/message/routed.rs`.
//
// Routed mode carries a message through intermediaries. The remaining hop list
// travels inside the HPKE-sealed payload of each routing layer, so only the
// addressed intermediary reads it. Nested mode is the degenerate wrapper: an
// inner packed message carried opaquely to a single intermediary.
//
// Rev 3 only, like everything on the packing side. Two changes from Rev 2 reach
// callers: the inner message is carried **raw** rather than inside a `B`
// var-data field, which makes it a caller error to hand one that is not
// quadlet-aligned; and the `-J` count is the hop group's byte length rather
// than the number of hops.
//
// Wallet → mediator → VTA is a routed send: pack the trust-task as a Direct
// message to the VTA (sealed end-to-end), then `packRouted` it to the mediator
// with `route = [vtaVid]`. The mediator opens the routing layer, sees the VTA
// as the next (and last) hop, and forwards the opaque inner to it.
