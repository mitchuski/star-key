## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/mediator`** — a client for a mediator's own
  `messaging/*` operations surface (statistics, queue ranking and status,
  accounts, message listing and deletion, preview-then-confirm purge, the
  traffic monitor), addressed to the mediator's DID over a holder's existing
  session. Subpath-only, like `admin` and `rooms`. Carries `accountHash`,
  `standingOf`, `MEDIATOR_VERSION_FLOOR` (0.28.36), `MonitorSequencer` and
  `PurgePlanStaleError`.
- `MediatorConnection.onMediatorFrame(listener)` — frames the mediator itself
  sent (monitor batches, replies that outlived their waiter), delivered apart
  from `onInbound` so they never reach a persist-before-ack handler.
- `problemReportError` / `PROBLEM_REPORT_TYPE`: `DidcommVtaTransport` turns a
  DIDComm problem report threaded to the request into a typed `VtaClientError`
  whose `details.code` is the report's descriptor, instead of a parse error.

### Changed

- **`@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js` floor raised to `^0.11.0`, and it is a
  correctness constraint.** Below it a mediator's Trust-Task replies are never
  acked (they accumulate in the holder's receive queue), a refusal threaded by
  `pthid` times out instead of arriving, and monitor batches reach `onInbound`.
- `@openvtc/trust-tasks` floor raised to `^0.20.1`, the first binding carrying
  `includeStats` / `includeActivity` on `messaging/account/*`.

- `key-export` (VTI#1619) and `persona-holder` join `ACL_CAPABILITIES`;
  `key-export` is derived by `admin` alone. `ADDITIVE_CAPABILITIES` and
  `isAdditiveCapability` name the capabilities no role derives, and
  `acl-capabilities.json` now snapshots them.
- `narrowingToSend(kept, stored, intent)` — the list an editor over a role's
  set should send, carrying any additive grant through.

### Fixed

- **A relayed task outlasts the VTA.** Tasks the VTA answers by waiting on a
  third party — `vta/webvh/dids/create` and the other server-managed did:webvh
  and agent-name verbs, room key reads, `vault/proxy-login`, `vta/services/*`,
  `provision/integration` — now get at least 80s, the budget `vta_sdk::budget`
  derives (two 30s TSP reply windows, the relationship re-form and client
  headroom), instead of the channel's 30s default. When the hosting server has
  lost its half of the TSP relationship, the VTA's first send is dropped
  silently and it re-forms and resends after its own 30s, so a DID created from
  the manager "timed out" while the create succeeded. New
  `vta/budget.ts`: `clientBudgetMs`, `minRelayBudgetMs`, `RELAYS_ONWARD`. It
  raises, never lowers, and tasks served from the VTA's own storage keep their
  budget.
- **`RestChannel` honours `timeoutMs`.** Its fetch deadline was fixed at 20s
  when the channel was built, so a per-request timeout was silently ignored. It
  is now applied per request (the same 20s default when none is given), which
  is what lets the relay budget reach REST.
- **An entry granted `persona-holder` read as holding nothing.** The agent
  narrows by an entry's non-additive names alone and adds the additive ones on
  top; this computed the role intersected with the whole list, so an entry
  granted only `persona-holder` intersected to the empty set. It now matches the
  agent, and `EffectiveCapabilities` reports the grant as `additive`.
  `checkNarrowing` no longer refuses an additive name for want of a role that
  carries it — whether the caller may confer one is the agent's check.
- **A narrowing to nothing cannot be sent, because the agent reads it as
  everything.** `[]` is the agent's instruction to clear a narrowing, and a
  list of additive names alone narrows nothing either. `narrowingToSend` refuses
  it rather than widening the entry to its whole role.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **0.9.0 shipped a partial build; this is the same source, published whole.**
  The tarball carried `dist/admin/acl-capabilities.js` but a stale
  `dist/admin/index.js` that did not re-export it and a stale
  `dist/admin/acl.js` with no `capabilitiesIntoExt` import. Two consequences
  for anyone installing 0.9.0 from the registry, the second much worse than the
  first:

  - the capability helpers were unreachable — `./admin` is the only exported
    subpath and its barrel did not name the module;
  - **`aclUpdate({ capabilities })` silently dropped the narrowing.** The call
    succeeded and no `ext` member went out, so an operator was told an entry
    was narrowed while it held everything its role allows — precisely the
    failure the feature was written to prevent.

  Nothing in this repo was affected: the extension and pwa build from source
  through project references, not from the tarball.

### Changed

- **`prepack` now cleans before it builds**, in this package and in
  `@openvtc/vti-tsp-js`. `files` is `["dist"]` with no build step bound to
  publishing, so `npm publish` shipped whatever `dist` happened to contain —
  and this package had no `prepack` at all, where its sibling did. `clean &&
  build` rather than `tsc -b`: an incremental build trusts `.tsbuildinfo` and
  can no-op over a stale `dist` (the trap CLAUDE.md warns about), and only a
  clean also drops files whose sources have been deleted.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **`admin/acl-capabilities` — the capability narrowing on an ACL entry.**
  VTI #1279 made `AclEntry.capabilities` enforced: the agent now re-reads the
  entry on every gated call, so an entry may hold *less* than its role implies.
  Nothing in this library could read or write that, so a console showed an
  entry as holding everything its role allows whether or not it did.

  New exports: `ACL_CAPABILITIES`, `ACL_ROLES`, `DERIVED_CAPABILITIES`,
  `CAPABILITIES_EXT_MEMBER`, `isAclCapability`, `isAclRole`,
  `capabilitiesFromExt`, `capabilitiesIntoExt`, `entryNarrowing`,
  `effectiveCapabilities`, `checkNarrowing`. `AclUpdateParams` gains an
  optional `capabilities`.

  Three things worth knowing before using it:

  - **A narrowing only ever subtracts.** The effective set is the role's
    derived set intersected with the entry's own, so `role` stays a true upper
    bound and this cannot hand a reader an admin's authority.
  - **Absent, `[]` and populated are three different instructions** on the
    write path — leave alone, clear, narrow. `capabilitiesIntoExt` therefore
    *writes* an empty array rather than omitting it, which is the one place it
    deliberately differs from the agent's own helper of the same name (that one
    serves the response path, where absent is the only spelling for "not
    narrowed").
  - **An unknown role returns `undefined`, not an empty set.** The two would
    render identically as "holds nothing", and one of them is a lie about an
    entry that may hold everything.

  This is the only `acl/*` surface written by hand rather than generated, and
  it has to be: `AclEntry.role` is specified as an opaque identifier, so roles
  and capabilities are ecosystem-local and ride `ext` under
  `org.openvtc.capabilities`. `acl-capabilities.json` — a committed snapshot
  refreshed by `npm run acl:sync`, same pattern as `task-surface.json` — is
  what stops the copy drifting.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-07

### Migration

- **`personaProfileGet`'s `resolved` entries lost three required members.**
  A caller reading `res.resolved[i].attributeId`, `.version` or `.updatedAt`
  as a `string`/`number` now gets `| undefined` and will not compile under
  `strictNullChecks`. That is the fix arriving, not a regression: the members
  are absent on an `inline` entry, and code that assumed them was assuming a
  profile cannot hold one. Guard on `attributeId === undefined` — that test is
  what identifies an inline claim.

  **Minor rather than patch, and no source in this package changed.** The type
  is re-exported from `@openvtc/trust-tasks`, so bumping the dependency moved
  this package's own public API — `personaProfileGet` returns
  `PersonaProfileGetResponsePayload` and the emitted `.d.ts` imports it
  straight from the binding. A build staying green says nothing about whether
  the API held when the API belongs to a dependency.

### Changed

- **`@openvtc/trust-tasks` 0.16.11 -> 0.17.1.** Carries the persona family's
  two projection fixes. The one that reaches a caller is
  `persona/profile/get`'s `resolved` array, now typed `ResolvedClaim` rather
  than the pool `Attribute` (dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#370): `attributeId`,
  `version` and `updatedAt` are OPTIONAL on a resolved entry, and their
  absence is what says the value is `inline` — held in one profile with no
  pool record behind it. Under the old type all three were required, so a
  conforming agent could not describe such a profile at all, and the console's
  "held only here" branch was unreachable by construction. No source change
  was needed: `personaProfileGet` returns the generated response type, and the
  console was already written against the corrected shape.
  `tests/admin.persona.mjs` now pins it, keyed on the generated schema
  rather than on this library's behaviour, so a downgrade fails rather than silently
  restoring a branch nothing can reach.
- **`task-surface.json` resynced to vta-sdk 0.33.0** (was 0.32.3). The surface
  did not move — the same 226 task URIs, 24 of them `persona/*`, all 24
  implemented here. VTI's breaking ACL change in that window
  (verifiable-trust-infrastructure#1279) narrows what an entry may do without
  adding a task or a schema member: an entry's capabilities travel in `ext` as
  `org.openvtc.capabilities`, which this library does not yet set.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-03

### Migration

- **`AclSwapResult` changed shape entirely.** `swapAcl` typed its reply as a
  flat ACL entry — `did`, `role`, `allowedContexts`, `createdAt: number`. The
  agent has not sent that since VTI #857: it responds
  `{ entry, previousSubject }`, and the entry names `subject` not `did`,
  `scopes` not `allowedContexts`, and dates as RFC 3339 strings not numbers.
  Every field a caller read came back `undefined`. Read `res.entry.subject`
  and `res.entry.scopes`; `res.previousSubject` is the DID that was swapped
  out. No caller existed in this repo, so nothing here broke — but any code
  reading the old shape was already getting nothing.
- **`ContextRecord.did` and `.description` are now optional, not nullable.**
  They were typed `string | null`; the published schema makes them OPTIONAL,
  so a conforming agent omits them. Code testing `=== null` never matched and
  never will — test for absence instead.
- **`WebvhDidRecord` gained seven members and made two required.** `serverId`
  and `portable` were optional here and are required by the schema;
  `mnemonic`, `scid`, `logEntryCount`, `preRotationCount`, `nextFragmentId`,
  `createdAt` and `updatedAt` were omitted entirely and are now available.
- **`PushRegistration` is the generated `WebPush` variant.** The schema
  declares `Apns | Fcm | WebPush`; this library narrows to the one a browser
  can produce, taken from the binding rather than restated.

### BREAKING

- The four types above now come from `@openvtc/trust-tasks` rather than being
  declared here. Structurally compatible code needs no change; anything that
  relied on the drifted shapes does.

### Fixed

- `swapAcl` returns what the agent actually sends (see Migration). Latent
  rather than live — nothing called it — and its one test built its fixture
  from the wrong type and never read it, so the drift was asserted rather
  than caught.

### Removed

- **Two compatibility folds, for peers that do not exist.** `contextsList`
  folded `base_path`/`created_at`/`updated_at`, and `vtaListDids` folded
  `context_id`/`server_id`, both justified as "agents migrate later". Nothing
  is deployed, and `ContextRecord`/`WebvhDidRecord` in `vta-sdk` both carry
  `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` — the agent emits the canonical
  spelling. Their `alias` attributes are deserialize-only and govern only
  what the agent *accepts*. The exported `fold()` helper is gone.

### Added

- `vault/credentials/*` client — `credVaultQuery`, `credVaultGet`,
  `credVaultReceive` and the five lifecycle verbs, with
  `isRunnableCredentialQuery` so a caller can check the at-least-one-filter
  rule locally rather than discovering it from a rejection.
- `admin/backup.ts` — `backupAbort` only. Export and import carry a password
  inbound and are deliberately absent; see the module header.
- `reloadServices` in `admin/services.ts`.
- `contextsUpdateDid` is now reachable from the console (it already existed
  here and was surfaced nowhere).
- `setActiveVtaDid` in the extension, alongside the existing readers.

### Changed

- Every task URI in `packages/core/src` now comes from
  `@openvtc/trust-tasks` rather than a hand-written string. The three
  `trust-task-error` constants stay written out on purpose — they are
  historical markers, matching is by slug across every `0.x`, and the current
  version is re-exported from the package runtime.


## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-28

### Migration

- **Every channel now requires a `signing: SigningIdentity`.** `RestChannel`,
  `TspChannel` and `DidcommVtaTransport` each take it as a REQUIRED
  constructor input, as do the `*RestOptions` bags that build a channel for
  you (`vaultList`, `vaultUpsert`, `vaultDelete`, `vaultGet`, `vaultRelease`,
  `vaultProxyLogin`, `vaultSignTrustTask`, `contextsList`, `contextsCreate`,
  `vtaListDids`, `setDeviceWake`). Pass the Ed25519 identity whose `did` is
  the envelope's `issuer` — `generateOrLoadHolderIdentity` already returns it
  as `signing` beside `identity`.

  `swapAclRest` and `swapAclDidcomm` take it as `ephemeralSigning`, and it
  MUST be the **ephemeral** identity: that DID is the envelope's `issuer`.
  The new holder's key vouches for the `linkProof` inside the payload, which
  is a different claim by a different party.

  It is required rather than optional deliberately. A channel that could be
  constructed without a signer is a channel that silently sends unsigned
  documents, and the failure only appears as a `proofRequired` refusal from
  the agent — at which point nothing local can tell you which of your call
  sites forgot.

### Fixed

- **Outbound Trust-Task documents now carry a Data Integrity proof** (SPEC
  §7.2 item 7a). 93 of the 141 task types this package speaks declare `proof`
  REQUIRED — every `vault/*`, `acl/*`, `vta/webvh/*`, `credential-exchange/*`
  and `vtc/*` mutation among them — and none of them was signed, so a
  conforming agent refused them with `proofRequired` before a handler ran.

  Item 7 admits **no transport substitute**: the REST bearer authenticates
  the connection, the TSP outer signature authenticates the frame, and the
  DIDComm authcrypt authenticates the sender of a message a mediator then
  forwards. None of them says the party named in `issuer` vouched for this
  payload. Signing happens at the channel — the one place every envelope
  passes through on its way out — so callers that build envelopes with
  `buildTrustTask` need no change beyond supplying the identity.

- **`DidcommVtaTransport` now sets `recipient` on the passkey-VM tasks.**
  `exchange` and `buildOutbound` both built envelopes with an `issuer` and no
  `recipient`, which SPEC §7.2 item 5b makes REQUIRED on every dispatched
  specification and item 8 audience-binds the proof to. A signed document
  naming no audience is replayable at another agent.

### Added

- `signOutboundTask(envelope, signing)` — attaches the proof in place, and
  refuses an envelope whose `issuer` is not the signer (SPEC §7.2 item 6)
  rather than spending a round-trip on the agent's rejection. Exported for
  consumers implementing their own `TrustTaskChannel`; the three bundled
  channels call it for you.
- `e.client.identity` — new `VtaErrorCode` for that refusal.

### Changed

- `@openvtc/trust-tasks` moves to `^0.16.3`. It adds only
  `consent/approve-request/0.1`, which this package does not implement.
- **Module layering:** `trust-tasks` is now a layer *below* `vta` rather than
  beside it, so the channel can reach the signer. No entry point moved and no
  export changed — `@openvtc/pnm-core/trust-tasks` and
  `@openvtc/pnm-core/vta` are exactly as before.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### Migration

- **`markInboundHandled(store, id)` is now `claimInboundDocument(store, doc)`,**
  and it returns `"fresh" | "duplicate" | "conflict"` rather than a boolean.
  Pass the **Trust-Task document** — a DIDComm envelope's `body`, not the
  message. `"conflict"` is the case the boolean could not express and must not
  be treated as a duplicate: SPEC §7.2 item 11 requires it be refused.
- **`matchesTrustTaskCode` / `trustTaskCodeSnakeCase` are gone.** Compare an
  extended error code with `===` against the spelling the registry declares
  today. (They landed after 0.4.0 was cut, so no released version exported
  them.)
- **`VaultEntry`, `SecretKind`, `SiteTarget`, `ProvisionSummary` and the
  passkey-VM payloads are now the generated types.** Structurally the same
  except where the hand-written copies had drifted: `targets` is a non-empty
  array, `transports` is optional, and an attachment's integrity is
  `digestMultibase` rather than a hex `sha256`.
- **`ProvisionIntegrationResponseBody.digest` is now `digestMultibase?`** — see
  *Digests* below.
- **`@cfworker/json-schema` is a new runtime dependency** (~6 kB gzipped, no
  dependencies of its own). It is what makes the consent payload actually
  checked against its schema.

### Fixed

- **A `sideEffects` value outside the schema's enum rendered to the human as
  the *safest* thing a consent surface can draw.** `parseTaskConsentRequest`
  checked the payload with hand-written `typeof` tests, and
  `typeof sideEffects !== "string"` admits any string where the schema admits
  `none`, `mutating` or `destructive`. A consent surface renders severity by
  comparing against those three and falls through to its calm styling for
  anything else, so a schema violation arrived looking reassuring. The payload
  is now validated against the published `PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`. The same block also
  missed `minApprovals >= 1` (`0` is a gate already open), `note`'s 500-char
  bound, and `additionalProperties: false`.
- **SPEC §7.2 item 11 was not implemented.** Inbound de-duplication recorded
  bare ids, which cannot express the half of the rule that matters — a
  *different* document under a used `id` MUST be refused, not absorbed — and
  keyed on the DIDComm message id, the transport identifier §7.2 names
  explicitly as one that MUST NOT substitute. Now keyed on the document's own
  id plus a digest of its RFC 8785 canonicalization.
- **`idConflict` was reported as a generic bad request.** It postdates the
  error-code mapping and is why the framework runtimes emit
  `trust-task-error/0.5`; it now maps to `e.p.msg.conflict`.
- **`keys/create` was missing `keyId`** — not optional in practice for an
  `internal` key, which derives from no seed and so has no path to be named
  after.

### Added

- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/app-state`** — agent-held key/value records scoped to a
  VTA context. Distinct from `/store`, which is one browser profile's own state
  and invisible on the user's other devices.
- **`trust-task-discovery/0.1`** (`discoverSupportedTypes`, `supportsType`) —
  ask an agent which Trust Tasks it supports. Read the answer negatively: a
  listed type is a capability claim, not a grant.
- **Passkey login as a Trust Task** (`startPasskeyLogin`, `finishPasskeyLogin`,
  `auth/passkey/login/*` 0.2), which separates a login from a step-up.
- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/admin` gains `vta/services/*`** (including drains) **and
  `vta/credentials/{issue,revoke}`**; `acl/update`; `vta/webvh/servers/
  retire-orphan`; and `vtc/members/removal-notice` as a parser, since a member
  receives it rather than sending it.
- **`validateAgainstSchema`** and the `validatePayload` seam, for SPEC §7.2
  item 2. Validation cannot be switched off, and an unusable schema refuses
  rather than passes.

### Changed

- **Adopting the generated types.** Wire shapes in `vta/protocol.ts`,
  `vault/list.ts`, `provision/send.ts` and `admin/keys.ts` come from
  `@openvtc/trust-tasks` rather than being transcribed. Every copy had drifted:
  the vault entry was written from `_shared/0.1` while the module posted 0.2,
  the passkey payload used a DOM type in the transport-free layer, and
  `admin/keys.ts` carried widenings for `internal` on `keys/create` and
  `origin: "internal"` that the registry has since specified.
- **Digests are `digestMultibase`, never hex.** `vault/{list,get,upsert}` and
  `provision/integration` moved to 0.3, which replaces bare-hex members with a
  self-describing multibase multihash. Compare by *decoding* —
  `decodeDigestMultibase` — because two encodings of one digest are the same
  digest. No bare-hex wire digest remains.
- **Task versions.** `vtc/join-requests/submit` 0.2 (a four-outcome `verdict`
  replaces `status: "pending"`, so an *admitted* applicant is no longer
  reported as pending), `device/wipe` 0.2, `vta/credentials/issue` 0.2.
- **Runtime dependencies refreshed:** `@noble/curves` ^2.4.0 and `cbor-x`
  ^1.6.6, both in-range and both things this package actually ships. The
  toolchain and UI dependencies of the private workspaces were deliberately
  left alone — `vite` in particular touches the MV3 bundle, and a bundle
  change is worth being attributable to its own commit rather than a release.
- **`@openvtc/trust-tasks` ^0.16.2**, which is the content the Rust side calls
  0.17.x — the two packages version their own APIs, not `SPEC.md`. 0.16.2 also
  makes `provision/integration/0.3`'s schema satisfiable; 0.16.0 shipped it
  requiring a `digest` its `properties` no longer defined.
- **Coverage against the agent's surface is 152 of 177 task families**, up from
  130. Every family that is specced, published as a binding and named by
  `vta-sdk` is implemented; all 25 outstanding are unspecced.


### Changed — module layout (landed before this release was cut)

- **The VTA's REST auth bootstrap moved from `vault/transport.ts` to
  `vta/auth.ts`.** `getVtaBearer`, `makeReauth`, `invalidateVtaBearer` and
  `VtaAuthInputs` were never vault-specific — they are how you authenticate to
  a VTA over REST — but living under `vault/` made `vta` and `vault` mutually
  dependent, so `import "@openvtc/pnm-core/vta"` pulled the entire vault
  surface in behind it. `VtaAuthInputs` is still re-exported from `/vault`, so
  nothing importing it needs to change.
- **The `base64url` helpers moved from `webauthn/` to `util/`.** Plain byte
  encoding, needed by `did/` and `vta/`, which had to depend on WebAuthn to
  get it. Still re-exported from `@openvtc/pnm-core/webauthn`.

### Added — earlier in this cycle

- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/admin` is built on `@openvtc/trust-tasks`**, the
  generated TypeScript bindings for the same JSON Schemas the agent's Rust is
  generated from. Payload types, response types and task URIs come from there;
  this package owns the call layer only — build the envelope, dispatch it,
  unwrap the answer.

  The first version of the module transcribed those shapes by hand from the
  Rust structs. Adopting the bindings caught two mistakes that copy had already
  made: `acl/show`'s response `entry` is **nullable** ("not in the ACL" is a
  successful answer, and it was typed as always present), and `acl/revoke`'s
  `scopes` has `minItems: 1`, so the empty array the hand-written version
  accepted — and had a test asserting — is not a legal request.

  (That module once carried two local widenings, for `internal` on
  `keys/create` and `origin: "internal"` on a key record, because the published
  schema had neither. It has both now, and the widenings are gone — see
  *Adopting the generated types* below.)
- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/admin` — agent administration.** The canonical `acl/*`
  Trust Tasks (`aclGrant`, `aclList`, `aclShow`, `aclRevoke`, `aclChangeRole`)
  plus `contextDelete` / `contextPreviewDelete`, over any `TrustTaskSender`, so
  they work against a REST, DIDComm or TSP agent without the caller choosing.
  Request bodies mirror `vta_sdk::protocols::acl_management` field for field —
  those structs are `deny_unknown_fields`, so an invented field is a rejected
  request, not a tolerated one.

  **Not exported from the package root**, deliberately: this is operator
  surface and a wallet should not ship it. Import it from the subpath. CI
  asserts the extension's bundle contains none of its task URIs.

  `acl/update` is absent until its response shape is confirmed with the Rust
  side; a decoder written from a guess is worse than a missing function.
- **`keys/*` in the same module** — `keysCreate`, `keysList`, `keysShow`,
  `keysRename`, `keysRevoke`, `keysSign`. Private key material never crosses
  this boundary: the agent derives, holds and signs, and returns public halves
  and signatures. `keysShow` resolves to `null` for a key the agent does not
  hold, because that is a successful answer rather than a failure.

  `keys/import` is absent: its body carries the private key in one of three
  mutually exclusive encodings (sealed, JWE, multibase), and modelling that
  honestly needs a sealed-envelope helper this library does not yet have.
- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/did-hosting`** — the `did-management/*` control plane
  (23 tasks). A **different counterparty**: these go to a did:webvh hosting
  service, which publishes DID documents and serves their logs, not to an
  agent. `dids.ts` manages individual DIDs, `domains.ts` the domains they are
  served under and the instances serving them.

  A DID is addressed by its **mnemonic** — the hosting service's handle for the
  record, unrelated to the BIP-39 phrase `keys/*` means by that word. The
  collision is the specification's; the module says so rather than letting a
  caller discover it.

  `reportHostedDidProblem` is one-way and takes a notifier: the task defines no
  response, which is the right shape for a courtesy report.
- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/vtc`** — the member's side of a Verifiable Trust
  Community: apply, track the application, hold the membership credential,
  leave. Eight tasks, not the sixty the bindings ship: the rest is the
  *community's* administration plane, implemented by a VTC rather than an
  agent, and wrapping it here would be building a VTC console inside a wallet
  library.
- **`device/register` and `device/heartbeat`** in the device module (the
  operator's half stays in `admin/devices.ts`). A heartbeat's
  `queuedOperations` is how a remote wipe reaches a device — a client that
  treats a heartbeat as a liveness ping and drops the array cannot be wiped.
- **`pushWake`** — spend a `WakeHandle`. `tokenUnregistered` means the
  subscription is gone: re-register rather than retry, or retry forever against
  a device that can never answer.
- **`auth/challenge` and `auth/refresh` as tasks**, for the transports where
  the bootstrap chicken-and-egg does not arise: TSP and DIDComm authenticate
  the sender in the envelope, so a client already speaking either can ask
  without a bearer. `vta/auth.ts` keeps the REST bootstrap, which cannot be a
  task. A refresh may **rotate** the refresh token — store what comes back.
- **`keys/*` is complete** — `keysImport`, `keysDeriveAndSign`,
  `keysDeriveAndSignDocument` join the six already there.

  `keysImport` takes **exactly one** of three carriers, enforced by its
  parameter type because the schema's `oneOf` does not survive into the
  generated TypeScript: `sealed` (an armored bundle only the agent can open),
  `jwe`, or `multibase` — and the last is a **cleartext private key**, which
  means it is in anything that touched the request. The doc comment says so
  where a caller will read it, since no type can.

  `keysDeriveAndSign` leaves no key record behind: nothing lists it and nothing
  revokes it, and an audit answers "who signed this" by re-deriving from the
  path rather than by looking it up.
- **`vaultGet`** — one entry's metadata, in the wallet-facing `vault/` module.
  Never the secret: releasing one is its own task with its own gating, so that
  reading a vault's contents and obtaining what is inside them stay separate
  authorities. `redactedFields` is surfaced rather than swallowed — an entry
  rendered without saying parts were withheld reads as a complete record.

  It does **not** re-export `VaultEntry`: `vault/list.ts` already exports a
  hand-written type of that name, and the two disagree (the spec's `targets` is
  a non-empty tuple; its `AttachmentRef` has no `sha256`). Migrating the rest
  of `vault/` onto the generated types is the same job `admin/` has had done,
  and is worth doing — but it changes a published surface, so it is not being
  slipped into a new call.
- **A one-way transport primitive: `TrustTaskNotifier.notify`.** Some tasks
  define no response document, and `send` — which awaits a reply — is the
  wrong call for them: it blocks until a timeout on a message the counterparty
  received perfectly and owes no answer to.

  `notify` resolves when the message reaches the transport, and promises
  nothing more. All three channels implement it: REST posts and treats a 2xx as
  delivered without reading the body (while still surfacing a refusal's code
  from a non-2xx — rejected is not delivered); DIDComm uses the bridge's
  existing fire-and-forget path; TSP uses an optional one-way `send` on the
  transport and, when the transport has none, **refuses with
  `e.client.unsupported` rather than falling back to `sendAndAwaitReply`** —
  the fallback would look like it worked and then hang. `VtaSession.notify`
  treats that code the way it always has, so a one-way task moves to a channel
  that can carry it.

  Callers take the narrower capability they need: functions that cannot report
  an outcome take a `TrustTaskNotifier`, so what a call can tell you is visible
  in its signature.
- **The threaded steps of a credential exchange** — `credentialOffer`,
  `credentialRequest`, `credentialIssue`, `credentialQuery`,
  `credentialPresent` — now that there is a primitive that can express them.
  Each carries an OID4VCI or OID4VP structure verbatim; `credentialIssue`
  enforces the cleartext-or-sealed union in the type, because sending both
  would ship the credential in cleartext beside the envelope that exists to
  avoid exactly that.
- **`@openvtc/pnm-core/credentials`** — `pendingPresentations`,
  `approvePendingPresentation`, `denyPendingPresentation`. The deferred
  presentations a verifier asked for while the holder was away, and the
  decision on them. A separate entry point from `admin/` because this is
  holder-side: a wallet reaches for it.

- **`consent/*` and `messaging/ping`.** Messaging consent — who may talk to an
  agent, on which platform, in which conversation — plus the approver bindings
  that decide who gets asked. Not to be confused with `task-consent/*`, the
  human-approval flow for privileged actions, which is inbound and lives in
  `inbound/`.

  A grant is identified by its whole subject (platform, conversation, kind,
  agent) rather than by an id, so every call carries all four. Two distinctions
  are pinned by tests because getting either backwards misinforms a user in the
  worst direction: a **recorded `deny`** is a decision and is surfaced rather
  than treated as an absence, while a **`rejected` decision** means the agent
  refused to record anything at all. And `agentPing` reports `degraded` — an
  agent that answers is not necessarily an agent that works.
- **`vta/did-templates/*` (2.0) and `vta/memory/*`.** Templates are the shape
  an agent stamps DIDs from; `didTemplateRender` performs the same substitution
  the agent would and returns the document **without creating anything**, which
  is the safe way to show an operator what they are about to publish under
  their own identity. `didTemplateUpdate` replaces rather than patches.

  Scoping differs between the two families and both are pinned by tests:
  omitting `contextId` on a template addresses the global namespace (a name can
  exist in both), while memory has no global namespace and requires one.
  `memoryList` returns keys, never values — enumerating memory does not spill
  its contents.

  Targets 2.0 for templates because that is what `vta-sdk` declares; the
  bindings also ship 1.0, and a 1.0 import compiles fine and fails at the
  agent. The conformance test is what catches that.
- **`device/*` (the operator half)** — `deviceList`, `deviceDisable`,
  `deviceWipe`. The device-side tasks (register, heartbeat, set-wake) stay in
  `device/`, since they belong to whatever is *being* a device. `deviceWipe`
  takes `scope` and `reason` as required parameters, matching a schema that
  refuses a wipe with no recorded reason.
- **`audit/list` and `config/{show,patch}`** — `auditList`, `configShow`,
  `configPatch`. `auditList` surfaces `truncated` rather than smoothing it
  away: a partial audit page read as a complete account is the failure an
  audit trail exists to prevent. `configPatch` returns all three outcome lists
  (`applied`, `pendingRestart`, `rejected`), because a caller reading only the
  status code will report a queued or refused setting as live.
- **`policy/*`** — `policyList`, `policyGet`, `policyUpsert`, `policyDelete`.
  Writes are optimistically concurrent: pass the `version` the operator was
  shown as `expectedVersion` and a racing edit is refused rather than silently
  overwritten. `module` (Rego source) is authoritative — the agent validates it
  and never synthesises it.
- **Session introspection** — `whoAmI`, `sessionsList`, `sessionRevoke`.
  `whoAmI` re-resolves roles and scopes at call time, so a role change since the
  token was minted is visible immediately. **`sessionsList` returns the
  caller's own sessions only**, unlike the agent's admin REST route which lists
  everyone's.
- **`task-surface.json` + a conformance test.** A committed snapshot of the
  VTA's canonical Trust-Task surface (175 tasks, from `vta-sdk` 0.25.0), and a
  test that checks this library against it: every task URI referenced here must
  exist in the agent's surface, none may target a version the SDK has
  deprecated, and coverage (of 161 task families) is a recorded number that
  moves in a diff rather than something you discover by grepping. Refresh with
  `npm run tasks:sync -- /path/to/vta-sdk`. It is a snapshot because `vta-sdk`
  lives in another repository and CI here builds from a cold checkout of this
  one — a test that needed the sibling checkout would not run where it counts.
- **Every module directory is now a published entry point** — `/vault`,
  `/didcomm`, `/store`, `/siop`, `/provision`, `/device`, `/inbound`,
  `/onboarding`, `/rp-login`, `/trust-tasks`, `/http`, `/util`, alongside the
  existing `/webauthn`, `/did` and `/vta`.
- **`sideEffects: false`**, so a bundler can drop any entry point a consumer
  never imports. No module does anything at import time.
- **Two tests that enforce the structure** rather than describing it:
  `package.module-boundaries.mjs` fails on a sideways or upward import, on any
  cycle between modules, and on a stale entry in its own exceptions list;
  `package.entry-points.mjs` imports every advertised entry point in plain Node
  with no DOM, and checks the `exports` map against the source tree.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **The sealed-bundle path no longer needs `crypto.subtle`, and no longer
  carries its own HPKE.** `provision/hpke.ts` used `@hpke/core` +
  `@hpke/chacha20poly1305` directly; it now calls `openBase` from
  `@openvtc/vti-tsp-js/hpke`, the ecosystem's single RFC 9180 implementation
  (pure TypeScript on `@noble`).

  The repo previously held two independent implementations of the same suite —
  base mode here, auth mode in tsp-js — which is the duplication the stack
  guide's **R4.1** warns about. There is now one key schedule.

  `hpkeOpen` keeps its exact signature, validation and error strings; the
  sealed-bundle wire format is unchanged. This is transparent to callers.

### Removed

- **`@hpke/core` and `@hpke/chacha20poly1305` are no longer runtime
  dependencies.** They are retained as dev-dependencies, where they now seal
  the fixtures that hold the new implementation byte-identical to the one it
  replaced.

  This matters for React Native hosts: `@openvtc/pnm-core` no longer drags a
  WebCrypto-dependent HPKE into the install. **It is not yet `crypto.subtle`-free**
  — WebAuthn, the PRF vault wrap, DID verification methods and trust-task
  canonicalisation all still use it. This removes HPKE from that list, not the
  rest.

### Security

- `hpkeOpen` — the VTA sealed-bundle decryption path — **had no direct test
  coverage** before this release. `tests/provision.hpke-open.mjs` adds seven
  cases in which the *sealing* side is hpke-js, deliberately the other
  implementation: a round-trip against our own seal would pass even if both
  directions drifted together. It covers the pinned `vta-sealed-transfer/v1`
  info binding, the chunk-header AAD binding, wrong-recipient, ciphertext and
  AAD tampering, and length validation.

### Fixed

- **Every VTA rejection was decoded as a success** (`vta/protocol.ts`).
  `isTrustTaskErrorType` enumerated `trust-task-error/0.1` and `/0.2`;
  `trust-tasks-rs` has emitted `/0.3` since its 0.3 release (it carries the
  §8.2 `inResponseTo` member, which `0.2`'s `additionalProperties: false`
  payload schema cannot). An unrecognised error document is not treated as an
  error — `parseTrustTaskReply` returns its payload as the operation's *result* —
  so a refused task reported success to the calling page. A `webvh/dids/update`
  the VTA refused rendered "your agent signed and published the update"; nothing
  was published.

  A `requireConsent` refusal travels as the same error document, so the
  consent ceremony was affected the same way: `requestTask` resolved as
  `accepted` instead of `consentRequired`, the cross-device match code never
  rendered, and no approver was ever asked. This is the more serious half — the
  failure is silent on both the requesting and the approving side.

  The predicate now matches the framework slug at any `0.x` minor (per SPEC.md
  §5.2 forward-minor compatibility), so a later minor cannot break it again.
  A major bump is still excluded: `1.x` is where the payload shape may change.
  Covers all four consumers — the REST channel, `parseTrustTaskReply`, the
  approver's decision-outcome reader and push-gateway registration — which
  already routed through this one predicate.

### Migration

Requires `@openvtc/vti-tsp-js` **≥ 0.2.0** — the dependency range moved from
`*` to `^0.2.0`. `*` expressed no floor, so it was satisfied by the old
`0.1.0`, which has no `./hpke` export; a consumer whose lockfile pinned
`0.1.0` would have installed this release against it and failed to resolve the
import. Nothing else in the public API changed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **`digestMultibase` decoding, and the approver match code derived from the
  digest bytes** (`trust-tasks/digest.ts`). Trust Tasks 0.4 moved
  `payloadDigest` to the shared `DigestMultibase` type — a multibase-encoded
  multihash — and landed it **errata-style, in place** on
  `task-consent/{request,decision,granted}/0.1`. The type URI did not move, so
  no version check can detect the change; the encoding is the only signal.
  `matchCodeFromDigest` multibase-decodes, strips the `0x12 0x20` sha2-256
  multihash prefix and renders the first bytes as hex, matching
  `vta_mobile_core::consent::match_code_from_digest` character-for-character
  (OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure#911). Because the digest is still
  SHA-256, this reproduces exactly the six characters the approver screen showed
  when the wire carried bare hex — the migration is invisible to the human.

  Slicing the *encoded* string would not have been: every SHA-256
  `digestMultibase` begins with a constant `zQm` (the base58btc marker plus the
  multihash prefix), so a six-character slice carries ~17.6 bits where the
  approver believes they are comparing ~35, while still looking like six random
  characters. A bare hex digest — the pre-0.4 wire form — is now refused rather
  than rendered, so a version-skewed request fails on the surface that would
  otherwise show a code for a decision the executor could never match.

### Fixed

- **VTA DIDComm auth → canonical Trust-Task type.** The authcrypt-auth
  primitive behind `vault/list`, `vault` transport, `contexts`, and
  onboarding `swap` posted the legacy `affinidi.com/atm/1.0/authenticate`
  message type to the VTA's `/auth/`. The VTA dropped that alias (it accepts
  only `auth/authenticate/0.1` now), so those calls would fail with
  `unexpected message type`. Switched the `VTA_AUTHENTICATE` constant in all
  four call sites to the canonical
  `https://trusttasks.org/spec/auth/authenticate/0.1` (the authcrypt body is
  unchanged). The SIOP REST login path was already canonical.

- **Consent-gated tasks now open the approval flow instead of dying silently.**
  `consentRequiredFrom` (behind `requestTask`) matched `auth:consent_required`
  against the trust-task-error's top-level `code`, but the VTA emits the
  standard `taskFailed` code and carries the reason in the error *details*. The
  check never matched, so every consent-gated task surfaced as a generic error
  and the cross-device approval UI never opened. Now keys on the machine-readable
  `details.reason`, with a fallback to the presence of the executor-signed
  `details.consentRequests` so it works regardless of whether the VTA in front
  of it emits the explicit reason yet. The prior tests encoded the wrong wire
  shape as correct and were rewritten against the real one.

### Migration

The `payloadDigest` **wire format changed**, on both sides at once and without
a type-URI version to signal it — Trust Tasks 0.4 re-pinned
`task-consent/{request,decision,granted}` errata-style, in place. This release
pairs with `verifiable-trust-infrastructure` **#911**; a wallet and an executor
on opposite sides of that change do not interoperate on consent.

**Upgrade the wallet and the VTA together.** Unlike the 0.1.3 authcrypt change
there is no dual-accept fallback to stage behind, because the digest is the
value the approver signs — accepting both encodings would mean accepting two
different digests for one payload, which is precisely the substitution the
digest exists to prevent.

The failure is fail-closed in both directions, which bounds the blast radius:

- **Wallet ≥ 0.3.0, VTA pre-0.4** (bare hex on the wire): the digest is refused
  as non-conforming, no match code is rendered, and approval is blocked with an
  explicit message.
- **Wallet ≤ 0.2.0, VTA on 0.4** (multibase on the wire): the old code slices
  the encoded string, so the wallet displays `zQmSK9…` where the requesting
  screen and the mobile approver display `3b0c7f`. Destructive approvals become
  impossible — the codes cannot match — while non-destructive ones still
  complete with a cosmetically wrong code shown. **Rebuild and reinstall the
  extension**; there is no store auto-update path in this repository.

Nothing is silently mis-approved in either direction.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Trust-Tasks 0.2 migration** (#59): `device/set-wake` and
  `vault/{list,upsert,release,proxy-login,sign-trust-task}` now target the
  `/0.2` Trust-Task URIs. `push/register` moved to `/0.2` once the gateway
  added 0.2 acceptance (vti-push-gateway#7). `provision/integration` moved off the legacy
  `firstperson.network` type to `https://trusttasks.org/spec/provision/integration/0.2`
  once the VTA added 0.2 dual-accept (#306); the signed BootstrapRequest VP's
  `ask.type` discriminator is now the 0.2 camelCase form (`adminRotation`). The
  `trust-task-error` parser now reads the canonical `message` field (was a
  non-existent `comment`) and accepts both `trust-task-error/0.1` and `/0.2`.
- `vta/passkey-vms/{enroll-challenge,enroll-submit,list,revoke}` moved from the
  pre-spec `/1.0` to the now-published `/0.1` once the VTA added `/0.1`
  dual-accept (#309, vta-sdk ≥ 0.10.0). Payloads are field-identical; this is a
  version-string bump.
- Bumped `@scure/base` `^1.1.9` → `^2.2.0` (API-compatible).

### BREAKING

- **`SecretKind` and `SiteTarget` `kind` enum *values* are now camelCase**
  (Trust-Tasks 0.2). These values cross the public `window.vtaWallet`
  provider API (e.g. `vaultList({ secretKind })` and the `secretKind` /
  `targets[].kind` on returned entries), so RP **web pages** that call the
  provider directly must update:

  | Before (0.1) | After (0.2) |
  | --- | --- |
  | `oauth-tokens` | `oauthTokens` |
  | `did-self-issued` | `didSelfIssued` |
  | `didcomm-peer` | `didcommPeer` |
  | `bearer-token` | `bearerToken` |
  | `ssh-key` | `sshKey` |
  | `web-origin` | `webOrigin` |
  | `ios-app` | `iosApp` |
  | `android-app` | `androidApp` |

  `password`, `passkey`, `custom`, and the `did` target kind are unchanged.
  `@openvtc/rp-sdk-js` is **not** affected — it verifies the login id_token,
  not vault calls.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Ship the `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js` **0.5.0** adoption (the dep pin moved
  to `^0.5.0` in the prior commit). 0.5.0 length-prefixes the ECDH-1PU
  Concat KDF `cc_tag`, making `ECDH-1PU+A256KW` authcrypt spec-correct
  and interoperable with credo-ts / didcomm-python /
  affinidi-messaging-didcomm ≥ 0.14 — and adds a dual-KEK decrypt
  fallback so an upgraded recipient still reads authcrypt from a
  not-yet-upgraded peer. `pnm-core`'s own API surface is unchanged; this
  is a version bump so the fixed authcrypt behaviour reaches npm
  consumers (the published `0.1.2` still pulled the pre-fix
  `vti-didcomm-js ^0.4.2`).

### Migration

The authcrypt **wire format changed** (via vti-didcomm-js 0.5.0): a 0.1.3
sender's authcrypt cannot be decrypted by a peer still on `pnm-core`
≤ 0.1.2 / `vti-didcomm-js` ≤ 0.4.x. **Upgrade recipients before
senders** — the dual-KEK fallback makes upgraded recipients accept both
old and new senders.
