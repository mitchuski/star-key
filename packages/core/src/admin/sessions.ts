// Session introspection — `auth/whoami`, `auth/sessions/list`, `auth/revoke-session`.
//
// What a console needs to answer "who am I to this agent, what am I allowed to
// do, and what else is signed in as me".
//
// **`sessionsList` lists the caller's own sessions, and only those.** The agent
// has a separate admin REST route (`GET /auth/sessions`) that lists everyone's;
// this task deliberately does not. A management UI that showed the result under
// a heading like "all sessions" would be lying about its own scope.
//
// `whoAmI` re-resolves roles and scopes at call time rather than reading them
// out of the access token, so a role change or a revocation since the token was
// minted is visible immediately. That is the reason to call it at all: the
// token's own claims go stale and this does not.
//
// Payload and response types come from `@openvtc/trust-tasks`.
