// `vta/services/*` 1.0 — which transports an agent runs, and how it stops
// running one without dropping what is in flight.
//
// Operator surface: enabling or disabling a transport changes how every client
// of that agent reaches it, so this is admin, not wallet. Reachable only as
// `@openvtc/pnm-core/admin`.
//
// **Disabling is a drain, not a switch.** `disable` takes a `drainTtlSecs` and
// the agent keeps serving what is already in flight until it lapses; a mediator
// under drain shows up in `drain/list` with a `drainsUntil`, and `drain/cancel`
// calls it off. A caller that treats `disable` as instantaneous will report an
// agent as off while it is still answering.

 * validation — turns "apply what is written down" into "apply what this
 * document says", which would let a caller put an agent into a state its own
 * configuration does not describe. So a reload is all-or-nothing, and the
 * agent's config stays the single account of how the agent runs.
 *
 * ## Two outcomes that are not failures
 *
 * **No response.** A successful reload drops the very transport the response
 * would travel on, so the connection may simply close. That is not an error and
 * **must not be retried as one** — the reload has very likely succeeded. The
 * reliable check is external to the call: reconnect and see whether the agent
 * answers.
 *
 * **`reloadFailed`.** The agent read its configuration and could not bring
 * services up on it. What state it is left in is implementation-specific, and
 * the code deliberately does not assert one: it may hold the previous config
 * and stay up, come up partially, or not come up at all. Do not report to an
 * operator that the agent is still serving.
 *
 * ## What it costs
 *
 * Every open session drops, including this wallet's own inbound sessions. The
 * cost falls on every counterparty of the agent, none of whom asked — which is
 * why the console puts it behind a step-up even though the task creates,
 * deletes and discloses nothing.
