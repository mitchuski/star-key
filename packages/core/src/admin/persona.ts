// The holder's own identity — `persona/*`, the half that sits ABOVE every
// trust context.
//
// ## Why this is here and not in `../persona/`
//
// `@openvtc/pnm-core/persona` is the **wallet's** half of this family, and it
// is deliberately incomplete: a wallet's holder identity is scoped to a
// context, so every task in this file would come back `e.p.msg.forbidden` if a
// wallet surface called it. That module says so in its own header, and CI greps
// the built extension bundles for every task URI below to keep the statement
// true rather than merely written down.
//
// So this module is the other half, and it lives beside the console's other
// operator surface for the same reason `admin/acl.ts` does: the management
// console is the one browser surface that administers an agent rather than
// acting as one inside it. The guard in `ci.yml` now names `manager.js` as its
// single exception, exactly as the `admin/*` guard does — and every wallet
// surface keeps the property that guard was protecting.
//
// ## The gate
//
// The agent refuses every one of them unless the caller is an **unscoped holder** —
// `Admin` *and* unrestricted scope (`require_super_admin`, not `role ==
// Admin`). That distinction is the whole design: an administrator scoped to one
// context who could read the pool would be reading identity data belonging to
// every *other* context, so they are refused here exactly as an application
// would be. `isUnscopedHolder` in the console's `use-vta.ts` is the client-side
// mirror, used to explain rather than to decide.
//
// ## The direction
//
// Nothing here reads *up* out of a context. `personaBindingSet` is the only
// call that touches both sides, and it writes **downwards**: it resolves an
// agent-scoped profile and pushes a materialised copy of the values into one
// context. A context never pulls, and there is no task in this file that would
// let it.
