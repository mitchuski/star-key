// The capability narrowing on an ACL entry — what a subject may do *within*
// the role it holds.
//
// ## Why this file exists rather than a generated binding
//
// Everything else in `admin/acl.ts` comes from `@openvtc/trust-tasks`, and the
// header there is emphatic about why: a hand-transcribed copy of the agent's
// shapes drifts. This file is the exception, and it is one because the
// framework has no vocabulary to generate from. `AclEntry.role` is specified as
// "an opaque role identifier interpreted by the ACL maintainer" — the schema
// deliberately does not know what `admin` means, and it knows even less about
// capabilities. So the narrowing rides `ext` under a reverse-DNS namespace,
// which is exactly what SPEC.md §4.5.1 reserves that member for.
//
// The two tables below are therefore a copy of `vti-common::acl`, and a copy is
// a liability. `task-surface.json` answers the same problem the same way, so
// this reuses that machinery: `acl-capabilities.json` is a committed snapshot
// refreshed by `scripts/sync-acl-capabilities.mjs`, and
// `tests/acl.capabilities.mjs` fails when this file and the snapshot disagree.
// A drift here is not cosmetic — a role whose derived set has grown at the
// agent and not here makes the console under-report what an entry can do,
// which is the exact misreading #1279 was written to end.
//
// ## What a narrowing means
//
// An explicit set only ever **narrows**, never widens: the effective set is the
// role's derived set intersected with the entry's own. Empty means "whatever
// the role implies" — the shape of every entry written before the agent gained
// this feature — so `role` stays a true upper bound, and an operator reading
// `role: reader` knows the entry holds no more than a reader whatever else its
// list says.
//
// The agent enforces this per gated call by reading the entry, not the token,
// so a narrowing binds the subject's next request rather than waiting for their
// next token mint. That matters to a console: the effect of a change here is
// immediate, and the UI should not imply otherwise.
