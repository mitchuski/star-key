// VTA→approver task-execution consent, per the published
// `task-consent/{request,decision}/0.1` Trust-Task specs.
//
// The user's own VTA asks this device to authorize one privileged task before it
// runs. The device renders what the VTA says the task will do, the human decides,
// and the device signs a decision the VTA consumes.
//
// ## Why this is not `confirm/*`
//
// The superficially similar `confirm/request` (retired ecosystem-wide; the
// registry marks it supersededBy task-consent) carried an
// **RP-authored `reason` shown to the user verbatim**, and that was correct there:
// in `confirm/*` the relying party holds the authority and is merely asking a
// human to vouch for something it will then do itself. The RP is the executing
// party, so RP-authored prose is prose from the party who will act.
//
// Task consent inverts that. Here the **VTA** holds the authority and will do the
// executing, and the requester is the least-trusted component in the system. If
// the requester could author what the human reads, it would be writing the basis
// of a decision that authorizes it — while every signature still verified. So:
//
//   **This module renders only content it has verified came from an executor
//   this device is enrolled with.** A request whose proof does not verify, or
//   which was signed by anyone outside the enrolled-executor set — the user's
//   own VTA(s) plus any other executors the operator has enrolled (e.g. a
//   DID-hosting control plane that signs task-consent requests) — MUST NOT
//   reach a human.
//
// ## Why the effects, and not the payload
//
// A payload says what was *asked for*. Only the code about to run knows what will
// *happen*, and it knows it only against state the requester cannot see: a
// `did:webvh` document update whose payload adds one service endpoint also
// rotates the DID's update key. That consequence lives in the handler's
// semantics, not the payload's shape, so no diff of the payload recovers it —
// which is why the VTA dry-runs the real handler and sends `effects`, and why a
// surface that rendered the payload instead would be confidently misinforming
// the person it was asking.

/**
 * Parse the executor's reply to a `task-consent/decision` this device sent.
 *
 * Returns `null` for anything that is not such a reply — that is the only case
 * a caller may ignore.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The executor answers a decision on the same DIDComm thread, as a Trust-Task
 * envelope: a `decision/0.1#response` document on success, a
 * `trust-task-error/0.x` on refusal. Nothing here recognised either, so
 * both fell through the inbound handler's final "anything else is ignored"
 * branch — no log, no surface, nothing.
 *
 * That is how an approval refused by the VTA looked identical, from this side,
 * to one that was delivered and worked: the human approved, the wallet sent,
 * the executor replied "no", and the wallet discarded the reply. The operator
 * then watched the requester re-submit forever with no clue which end was at
 * fault. Reading the answer is the difference between a two-minute diagnosis
 * and an afternoon of packet-staring.
 *
 * ## What is trusted
 *
 * The sender the **transport authenticated** — `senderDid`, which the caller
 * takes from the mediator session (the authcrypt `skid`'s DID) or from the TSP
 * unpack — and only to decide whether to *believe* the reply: it is
 * diagnostic, and grants nothing. It must be exactly the executor the decision
 * was sent to (`expectedExecutorDid`). Anyone else — including another
 * enrolled executor — is dropped: a party that did not receive the decision
 * must not be able to tell this device that its approval failed (a lie that
 * invites the human to approve a second time, and that makes the wallet forget
 * the decision it is waiting on), nor that it succeeded.
 *
 * `message.from` is **not** consulted. It is a value the sender writes into the
 * plaintext, so matching on it would make the check exactly as strong as the
 * weakest link that ever carried the message.
 *
 * When the reply document carries a Data Integrity proof, it must verify, be
 * signed by `expectedExecutorDid`, and name that DID as `issuer`. The executor
 * signs its success responses; its error documents are unsigned (the framework
 * makes their proof RECOMMENDED), so a missing proof is not by itself a
 * refusal — the authenticated sender is then the evidence.
