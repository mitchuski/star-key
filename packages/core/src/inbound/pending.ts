// Durable store for inbound messages that have been delivered but not yet
// finished with (R1.6).
//
// The mediator deletes its queued copy the moment we ack, and the transport
// acks as soon as the `onInbound` handler's promise settles. So between "the
// message arrived" and "we durably wrote it down" the mediator's copy is the
// ONLY copy — and in MV3, teardown in that window is normal operation, not a
// crash. A `task-consent/request` lost there is unrecoverable: the challenge
// and payloadDigest it was signed over are gone, the VTA waits for a decision
// that can never arrive, and nothing reports a failure.
//
// So: write the whole message here BEFORE the handler resolves, and delete it
// only once the interaction has actually concluded. Anything still present at
// startup is work that was interrupted — see `listPendingInbound`, which the
// offscreen document drains on boot.
//
// This is deliberately separate from `dedup.ts`. That answers "have I already
// PROMPTED for this?" and is what stops a mediator replay raising a second
// popup. This answers "is this still OUTSTANDING?". A message can be both —
// prompted, then interrupted before the user decided — and in that case it
// must be re-driven rather than skipped, which is why the drain path bypasses
// the dedup check.
