// `release: stepUp` — the disclosure the holder has to approve afresh, every
// time.
//
// A claim type whose registry entry says `release: stepUp` (`payment.*`,
// `gov.*`) cannot leave on the two-call preview gate alone. The agent refuses
// `persona/disclosure/present` and hands back a signed approve-request; the
// holder authenticates freshly; the same preview is presented again and goes
// through.
//
// ## The binding is to the preview, and that is the whole point
//
// `CLAIM-TYPES.md` §3.2: the approval is bound to *that* preview, never to the
// session. Bound to the session, "each time" would mean "once per login",
// which is the failure the requirement exists to prevent. So this module never
// treats an elevated session as evidence of anything — a refusal is answered
// by approving, and by approving nothing else.
//
// ## The refusal is returned, not thrown
//
// Modelled on `vta/request-task.ts`'s `ConsentRequired`, and for the reason
// written there: a refusal that carries what the holder must act on is the
// worst possible thing to let propagate as an error. The caller shows
// "Error: stepUpRequired", strands the holder at the moment they were supposed
// to act, and the retry the agent explicitly offered is discarded at the last
// hop.
//
// The union return type is deliberate: a caller cannot reach the disclosure
// without saying what it does about the refusal. This landed **before** any
// surface drove a disclosure, which is the cheap moment to do it — after N
// callers exist it is a breaking change to each of them.
//
// ## One asymmetry worth knowing
//
// `ConsentRequired` is matched on `details.reason`, because the VTA rejects it
// with the standard `taskFailed` and the specific token rides in the details.
// **This one is matched on the top-level `code`**, because
// `persona/disclosure/present/1.0` declares its own extended code and the
// agent emits it there. Looking in `details` for this — the habit the
// neighbouring module teaches — finds nothing, and the flow dies silently.
