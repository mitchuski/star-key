// Device — push/register (push wake-up binding, https://trusttasks.org/binding/push/0.1).
//
// A device registers its platform push channel (here: a Web Push subscription)
// with a push GATEWAY and names the controller VTA permitted to provision its
// trigger allowlist. The gateway holds the raw token and returns an opaque
// `WakeHandle` in exchange.
//
// Transport: `push/register` is UNAUTHENTICATED over HTTPS (binding §"register"
// — the handle is opaque and useless until the controller VTA provisions a
// trigger), so this is a plain `POST {gateway}/trust-tasks` of the canonical
// Trust Task document. No DIDComm, no bearer — it runs fine in an MV3 service
// worker (which can't do DIDComm). The handle is then conveyed to the VTA via
// `device/set-wake`.
