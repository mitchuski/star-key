// Onboarding key rotation — the wallet's ephemeral did:key, granted into a
// VTA's ACL by the operator, is swapped onto the wallet's long-term holder
// did:peer via the canonical Trust Task `acl/swap-key/0.1`.
//
// Two proofs ride along, exactly as the VTA's swap-key handler expects:
//   - the transport authenticates the **ephemeral** (the `currentSubject` being
//     rotated away from) — DIDComm authcrypt sender / REST bearer session;
//   - the inner VP-JWT (`issueSwapPresentation`), carried as `linkProof`,
//     proves control of the **holder did:peer** (the `newSubject`).
//
// Transport-agnostic: `swapAcl` sends the `acl/swap-key/0.1` Trust Task over any
// TrustTaskSender whose identity is the ephemeral. The VTA routes it through the
// shared dispatcher (`handle_swap_key`) over REST / DIDComm / TSP identically.
//
// NOTE: currently unused — onboarding adopts a VTA-minted holder via
// `runProvisionIntegration` (M2C) rather than self-minting + swapping. Kept
// consistent with the channel pattern for when a swap-based flow is needed.
