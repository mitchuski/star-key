// DIDComm v2 facade over `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js`.
//
// This module is the single seam between `@openvtc/pnm-core` and the
// underlying DIDComm implementation. It used to wrap a WASM crate;
// it now wraps the pure-JS `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js` library. The
// public surface (Identity, pack*/unpack*, wrapForward, the type
// shapes) is kept stable so consumers only had to learn that the
// pack/unpack calls became async.
//
// Scope of the current library version: X25519 key agreement,
// ECDH-1PU+A256CBC-HS512 authcrypt and ECDH-ES anoncrypt, single
// recipient per envelope. The type surface intentionally stays
// broader than that (OKP|EC, X25519|P-256|secp256k1) because did:peer
// and P-256/secp256k1 support are landing in the library — when they
// do, this facade needs no change since it only forwards JWKs to the
// library's curve-dispatching pack/unpack.
