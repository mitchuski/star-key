// Logging in to a relying party as an ordinary pair of Trust Tasks.
//
// `auth/challenge/0.1` then `auth/authenticate/0.2`, over any
// `TrustTaskSender` — so a login runs on whichever transport the RP advertises,
// priority TSP > DIDComm > REST, exactly as every VTA operation has since #79.
//
// **What this replaces.** `didcomm.ts` sends a bespoke DIDComm message and the
// RP authenticates on the authcrypt sender, reading nothing from the body. That
// works, but it is a different rule than the RP applies over HTTPS, it exists
// only on one transport, and it makes the `challenge` the canonical task
// declares REQUIRED into a field nobody checks. A challenge that is never
// checked is not a weaker guarantee than one that is — it is no guarantee, and
// the difference is invisible from the client.
//
// **The proof is the authentication.** The channel signs every outbound
// document (`signOutboundTask`, SPEC §7.2 item 7a) and the RP establishes the
// caller from that signature. Possession of a challenge proves nothing on its
// own; possession plus a signature over a document carrying it proves control
// of the VID. That is what makes this identical over three transports rather
// than three rules — the guarantee rides with the document, not the pipe.
//
// Requires an RP that dispatches the auth family as Trust Tasks
// (affinidi-webvh-service #171). Against one that does not, the challenge comes
// back `unsupportedType` and the caller can fall back to `loginViaDidcomm`.
