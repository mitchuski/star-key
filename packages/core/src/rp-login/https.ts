// No bearer is sent. The document's proof is the authorisation. That is what
// lets a login run here at all: `auth/challenge` and `auth/authenticate` come
// before there is a session to present.
//
// Two checks make the reply evidence rather than bytes. The request must be
// addressed to `rpDid` (the pinned relying party), and the reply must be
// signed by it and threaded to the request (`decodeTrustTaskHttpReply` with
// `expectedSigner` and `inReplyTo`). The page can choose the base URL, but it
// cannot make the wallet accept an answer from anyone else.
