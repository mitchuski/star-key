// Data rooms — `rooms/*`.
//
// A room is a shared, credential-governed space: a set of records readable and
// writable by exactly the parties its credentials admit. Two things about the
// shape of this module follow from the design and are worth stating before the
// functions, because neither is guessable from the call signatures.
//
// ## Two services, and a call goes to exactly one of them
//
// `rooms/keys/*` go to the member's **own VTA**, which holds the group keys and
// opens and seals records. `rooms/{create,records,epoch,owner}/*` go to the
// room's **host**, which stores ciphertext it cannot read and authorises every
// operation against credentials the *room* issued — never against a list of its
// own. That is why a room can move hosts without reissuing anything, and it is
// why these helpers take `service` per call rather than binding one up front.
//
// The split is not cosmetic. Sealing a record and being allowed to store it are
// different questions asked of different parties: the VTA knows the key and
// nothing about the room's ACL; the host knows the credentials and cannot read a
// byte. A surface that wrote to a sealed room does both, in that order.
//
// ## Writing to a sealed room is two calls
//
//     roomsKeysSeal(vta, …)   → ciphertext
//     roomsRecordsPut(host, …) → stored
//
// and the `version` passed to the first must be the version the second will
// take, because it is bound into the ciphertext. Get it wrong and the record
// stores fine and never opens. `roomsWriteSealed` below does the pair correctly
// for the create-only case, which is the shape that works.

 *
 * The published schemas type the two ends of this value differently: this

 * `$ref`s `AuthorityPresentation`, whose `membership` and `authority` are
 * REQUIRED. So the type that comes back does not fit the parameter it exists to
 * fill, and the only ways past that are a blind cast or a check.
 *
 * A blind cast moves the failure: a presentation missing its chain reaches the

 * authorized by the chain" — an accusation aimed at the member, three hops from
 * the agent that actually produced the empty answer. Checking here names the
 * party that did.

// ── Owner issuance ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// These go to the owner's own VTA, which signs AS the room with a key it
// holds. `signingKeyId` names that key — it is not looked up from `roomId`,
// because nothing maps a DID to the key it was minted with, and a mapping
// invented for convenience is a mapping that goes stale after a rotation.
//
// The pair you need comes from minting the room's DID: `vta/webvh/dids/create`
// with `template: "room"` returns both `did` and `signingKeyId`. Keep them
// together — the DID alone cannot issue anything.
