// **The counterparty is the agent, not the hosting service.** That is the whole
// distinction between this module and `did-hosting/`: there, the recipient is a
// webvh *hosting service* that publishes a document at a URL and serves its log,
// and the agent is merely one of its clients. Here the recipient is the agent
// itself, which holds the keys and signs the log entries. Only the agent can
// mint or update a DID it controls; the hosting service can only serve what it
// is given.
//
// A DID here is addressed by its full `did:webvh:...` string, not by a hosting
// mnemonic. `serverId` names a hosting registration the agent already holds;
// its absence means **serverless** — the caller serves the log itself, and the
// agent keeps no hosting registration for it.
