// DID verification for the consent prompt.
//
// Before the wallet logs into an RP, the consent popup wants to tell the
// operator whether the rpDid actually resolves — and, for did:webvh, whether
// its declared domain is consistent with the page origin the request came
// from. This is the operator-facing complement to origin pinning: pinning
// catches "this site swapped which RP it points at"; verification catches
// "this site is pointing at an RP whose DID does not resolve" or "claims an
// RP whose domain has nothing to do with the page".
//
// did:webvh resolution is cryptographic (the library walks the log, verifies
// the SCID/hash chain, and verifies every Data Integrity proof on each entry)
// — a successful resolve is a real attestation, not just "fetch returned 200".
// did:peer / did:key are self-certifying (the keys are encoded in the id), so
// resolution is purely structural validation.
