// Contexts — the `vta/contexts/*` family, as dispatcher trust-tasks.
//
// The popup's AddEntryForm fetches the operator's accessible contexts (to
// populate the context picker) and can create a new context inline. Both run
// as canonical trust-tasks over a TrustTaskChannel/VtaSession, so they work on
// a DIDComm-only VTA as well as REST.
//
// **Every URI and the record shape come from `@openvtc/trust-tasks`.** They
// used to be hand-written here, alongside a hand-declared `ContextRecord` and a
// header claiming the wire was snake_case. None of that was true any more, and
// two of them were wrong in a way nothing would have caught: the hand-written
// record typed `did` and `description` as `string | null`, where the published
// schema makes them OPTIONAL — an agent omits them, so a caller testing
// `=== null` never matches, and TypeScript agrees with the caller. Taking the
// type from the binding means the schema is the only place that shape is
// stated.

 * *emits* camelCase and has done since the casing change. Its `alias`

 * spelling, which says nothing about what it sends.
 *
 * A fold kept past its cause is worse than none: it reads as a live constraint,
 * and the next person maintaining this file has to work out whether some peer
 * still needs it. SPEC §4.10 names one spelling — match it with `===`.
