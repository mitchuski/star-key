// The TSP TrustTaskChannel.
//
// Carries a canonical Trust-Task envelope over TSP (Trust Spanning Protocol),
// the highest-preference transport (TSP > DIDComm > REST). Like DIDComm, TSP is
// sender-authenticated by its envelope, so this channel needs no bearer.
//
// Wire binding (confirmed against the VTA's `tsp_inbound.rs`): the TSP message
// plaintext is the Trust-Task envelope JSON — byte-identical to the REST
// `/trust-tasks` body and the DIDComm message body — with NO extra binding
// wrapper. The VTA seals its framework response document back to the proven
// sender VID over TSP; we unpack it and decode with the shared
// `parseTrustTaskReply`.
//
// pack/unpack + CESR framing + HPKE live in `@openvtc/vti-tsp-js` (proven
// byte-compatible with affinidi-tsp, the crate the VTA links). This class owns
// only the trust-task binding + transport dispatch; the actual send/receive of
// packed bytes is an injected `TspTransport` (mediator-backed in production, a
// simulator in tests).
//
// **We send spec Rev 3 and read Rev 3 or Rev 2.** The revision is not
// negotiated and cannot be: an inbound message carries a version marker that
// says what it is, an outbound one has nothing to read. So `unpack` here still
// passes the VTA's X25519 public key — which Rev 3 ignores and Rev 2 needs to
// open a message at all — and `pack` does not. A VTA still on affinidi-tsp
// 0.1.x cannot read what we send; that is the cutover, not a bug.
