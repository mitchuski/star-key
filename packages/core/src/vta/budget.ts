// How long the wallet must wait for a Trust Task, given what the VTA may do
// with it on the way.
//
// A port of `vta_sdk::budget` (verifiable-trust-infrastructure). Read that
// module for the whole story; the short version:
//
// Some tasks the VTA answers by calling a third party and waiting — minting a
// did:webvh relays onward to the DID hosting server. The VTA waits up to
// `TSP_REPLY_TIMEOUT_MS` for that hop, and if the hosting server has lost its
// half of the TSP relationship the frame is dropped silently (Rev 3 §7.2.2),
// so the VTA only learns of it when that wait expires. It then re-forms the
// relationship and resends, spending a second full window. A caller that
// allows less than that does not fail faster: the work still happens, the
// answer still comes, and the caller has stopped listening. Observed live — a
// DID created from the manager "timed out" at 30s while the VTA's recovered
// answer arrived at 30.07s.
//
// > A caller's budget must strictly exceed the worst case of whoever it is
// > waiting on.
//
// The numbers mirror the Rust module exactly. The list is the Rust list less
// the tasks this wallet never sends (`vault/proxy-login/0.1`, superseded;
// `vta/services/update/1.1`; `rooms/owner/anchor/0.1`) — a budget only matters
// for a task that leaves here, and `task-surface` holds this file to the tasks
// the wallet speaks. `vta/services/enable` and `update` are relayed too, but
// they are console-only admin tasks, and this file ships in every wallet
// surface: `admin/services.ts` gives them `minRelayBudgetMs()` itself. If
// either side changes, change the other.
