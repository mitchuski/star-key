// The REST TrustTaskChannel.
//
// Carries a canonical Trust-Task envelope over HTTP: authenticate to the VTA
// for a short-lived bearer (the DIDComm-authcrypt `/auth/` handshake), POST
// the envelope to the trust-task dispatcher (`<base>/trust-tasks`), and decode
// the reply with the shared `parseTrustTaskReply`.
//
// This is the ONLY channel that carries a bearer — TSP and DIDComm are
// sender-authenticated by their envelope, so their channels need no token.
// The whole bearer story (challenge round-trip, cache, per-IP rate-limit
// avoidance, 401 self-heal) is quarantined here in `getVtaBearer`/`makeReauth`
// and never leaks into a domain op.

 *     failure. Parse first; fall back to the generic HTTP error only when the
 *     body is not a Trust Task at all.
 *  2. Read the body ONCE. `res.json()` consumes the stream, so every path here
 *     works from the parsed `doc`. Handing `res` to `errorFromResponse` after
 *     parsing would re-read a spent body, lose the server's code to that
