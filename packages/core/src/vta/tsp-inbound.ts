// Executor-initiated TSP messages: verify one, and shape it like the DIDComm
// inbound the wallet already knows how to handle.
//
// The VTA pushes `task-consent` and step-up requests to a wallet. Over DIDComm
// those arrive as a binding envelope (`TRUST_TASK_ENVELOPE_TYPE`) whose `body`
// is the Trust-Task document; over TSP as the TSP binding's own envelope
// (`TSP_BINDING_ENVELOPE_TYPE`), whose `document` is the same thing. Each
// binding says "this is a Trust Task" in the one place its transport gives it —
// so the two paths differ only in carriage, and this module makes that the only
// difference the inbound pipeline sees.
//
// **The pipeline is already document-centric**, which is why the adaptation is
// honest rather than a fudge: `parseTaskConsentRequest` verifies the
// Data-Integrity proof on the document, and dedup is claimed on the document
// (SPEC §7.2 item 11 — "transport message identifiers MUST NOT substitute for
// the document `id`"). Nothing downstream trusts the envelope for anything
// security-bearing. What it does read is `type`, as the discriminator for "this
// carries a Trust-Task document", and `from`, for the sender — and both of
// those this module supplies truthfully.
//
// **The sender is a candidate until unpack proves it.** A TSP frame names its
// sender and receiver in cleartext CESR, before any crypto, which is how the
// mediator routes without keys. We read that VID only to look up which keys to
// try; `unpack` then verifies the Ed25519 signature and the HPKE-Auth
// sender-binding against them, so a frame claiming to be from an executor it
// cannot authenticate as fails there rather than reaching a human. Reading the
// cleartext VID and *believing* it are different acts, and only the first
// happens here.
