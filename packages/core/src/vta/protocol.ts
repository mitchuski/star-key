/**
 * Trust-Tasks passkey-VM management over DIDComm.
 *
 * The VTA exposes passkey verification-method enrollment as Trust-Tasks
 * under the `trusttasks.org` namespace. Over DIDComm they ride the
 * framework binding (`https://trusttasks.org/binding/didcomm/0.1`): every
 * request is a single reserved DIDComm message type
 * ({@link TRUST_TASK_ENVELOPE_TYPE}) whose `body` is a full `TrustTask`
 * document; the document's own `type` selects the operation. Replies are
 * also binding envelopes whose body is the framework response document
 * (success) or a `trust-task-error/0.1` document (failure), correlated by
 * the DIDComm `thid`.
