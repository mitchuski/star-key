// Refresh `task-surface.json` — the checked-in snapshot of the VTA's canonical
// Trust-Task surface, and the thing `tests/task-surface.mjs` checks this
// library against.
//
//   npm run tasks:sync --workspace @openvtc/pnm-core
//   npm run tasks:sync --workspace @openvtc/pnm-core -- ../path/to/vta-sdk
//
// Why a snapshot rather than reading the Rust at test time: `vta-sdk` lives in
// another repository, and CI here builds from a cold checkout of this one. A
// test that needed the sibling checkout would simply not run in CI, which is
// where it matters. So the surface is committed, refreshed deliberately by a
// human running this, and the refresh shows up in a diff someone reviews.
//
// The snapshot records where it came from and when. A stale one is not a
// silent failure — `tests/task-surface.mjs` reports the version it is checking
// against, and a task this library targets that the SDK has since renamed or
// deprecated fails the test rather than the deployment.
//
// ## Not every constant is a literal, and the ones that are not were vanishing
//
// `vta-sdk` increasingly derives a task constant from the generated payload
// type rather than writing the URI out:
//
//     pub const JOIN_REQUEST_MANIFEST_TYPE: &str =
//         <manifest::v0_1::Payload as trust_tasks_rs::Payload>::TYPE_URI;
//
// There is no string to match, so the scan missed it and the task simply was
// not in the snapshot — and `tests/task-surface.mjs` then reports it as a URI
// this library names that **the SDK does not have**, which is the sentence it
// uses for a typo or a task that was dropped. That is the worst possible
// wording for a scanner limitation: it is indistinguishable from a real
// version-left-behind, and the one it was mistaken for
// (`vtc/join-requests/manifest/0.1`) is still exported by the SDK and still
// dispatched by vtc-service.
//
// So the resolver below follows the `pub use trust_tasks_rs::specs::…` aliases
// and reconstructs the URI from the module path. And where it **cannot**
// resolve one, this script now fails rather than writing a snapshot with a hole
// in it. Silent omission is what made the limitation look like a finding; a
// loud stop is a scanner that says "I do not understand this", which is the
// true statement.

// rather than a convenience. `node --test` runs test FILES in parallel
// processes, and `tests/task-surface.mjs` reads the checked-in snapshot at
// module scope — so a sync test that wrote the real file and restored it
// afterwards raced the test next door, which read either the fixture's handful
