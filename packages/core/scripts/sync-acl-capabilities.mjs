// Same reasoning as `sync-task-surface.mjs`, for the same reason: `vti-common`
// lives in another repository and CI here builds from a cold checkout of this
// one, so a test that read the Rust at test time would simply not run where it
// matters. The snapshot is committed, refreshed deliberately, and shows up in a
// diff someone reviews.
//
// What makes this one worth the machinery: roles and capabilities are
// ecosystem-local, so unlike every other `acl/*` shape there is no generated
// binding to import and the TypeScript tables are a hand-kept copy. A role
// whose derived set grows at the agent and not here makes the console
// UNDER-report what an entry can do — the exact misreading VTI#1279 was
// written to end.
