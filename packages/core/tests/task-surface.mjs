// This library against the agent's canonical Trust-Task surface.
//
// Every VTA call this package makes names a task URI. Three ways that goes
// wrong, none of which any other test here would catch:
//
//   - a **typo or a rename**: the URI is well-formed, the agent has never heard
//     of it, and the failure arrives as a rejected request at a user;
//   - a **version left behind**: the agent still accepts `vault/list/0.1`
//     during its deprecation window, so everything works right up until the
//     release that drops it;
//   - a **gap nobody can see**: the agent grows tasks, this library does not,
//     and the distance is invisible until somebody goes looking.
//
// The first two fail this test. The third is reported as a number that moves in
// a diff, because a library heading for general use should make its own
// coverage reviewable rather than a thing you discover by grepping.
//
// The canonical side is `../task-surface.json`, a committed snapshot of
// `vta-sdk` — refresh it with `npm run tasks:sync`. It is a snapshot because
// `vta-sdk` is in another repository and CI here builds from a cold checkout of
// this one; a test that needed the sibling checkout would not run where it
// counts.

  // travel in `ext` as `org.openvtc.capabilities`, which this check cannot
  // see and this library does not yet set.
  //
  // It was 130 until the specced-but-unimplemented gap was closed in one pass: `trust-task-discovery/0.1`,
  // `acl/update/0.1`, `vta/webvh/servers/retire-orphan/0.1`,
  // `vtc/members/removal-notice/0.1`, `vta/app-state/*` (6), `vta/services/*`
  // (8), `vta/credentials/{issue,revoke}/0.1`, and
  // `auth/passkey/login/{start,finish}/0.2`.
  //
  // 160 -> 161 is `vta/credentials/list/0.1`, and the canonical total moved
  // with it (177 -> 178) because the task did not exist on either side before.
  // Specified at trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#342 and implemented at
  // OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure#1235, in response to a gap this
  // console surfaced: `revoke` is keyed on a `credentialId` that `issue`
  // returns exactly once, so an issuer that had not recorded it could not ask.
  // Unlike the eight below, this is not a family that moved off the unspecced
  // list — it is new.
  //
  // 152 -> 160 is the whole `vault/credentials/*` sub-family — receive, query,
  // get, archive, unarchive, delete, restore, purge — which moved here from
  // the unspecced list rather than from a backlog. The agent had been
  // dispatching all eight with no schema in the registry; specifying them
  // (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#338, shipped in @openvtc/trust-tasks
  // 0.16.4) is what produced bindings to implement against.
  //
  // 161 -> 163 is `vta/backup/abort` and `vta/management/reload-services`,
  // specced at trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#347 and shipped in
  // @openvtc/trust-tasks 0.16.8. Same shape as the eight before them: the
  // agent was already dispatching both with no schema in the registry.
  //
  // **`vta/backup/*` is now specced in full and deliberately implemented in
  // part**, which makes it the first family whose absence is a decision rather
  // than a gap upstream. All five verbs have bindings; this library exposes
  // `abort` alone. `initiate-export` and `finalize-import` carry a `password`
  // — the key to a complete copy of the agent, travelling inbound — and a
  // browser is the wrong place to collect it, for reasons `admin/backup.ts`
  // sets out at length. Do not "finish" the family to make this number
  // rounder; the four that are missing are missing on purpose.
  //
  // **The other 15 outstanding are unspecced** — no schema in the registry, so
  // no binding in @openvtc/trust-tasks to implement against: `vault/*`'s own
  // archive/restore/purge/unarchive (the *secrets* lifecycle, distinct from
  // the credential one above), `vta/attestation/*`, `vta/seeds/*` and
  // `vta/audit/*-retention`.
  //
  // `vta/seeds/*` is a third category again, and will never move: it returns
  // key material, and CI bans its URIs from every extension bundle including
  // the console. A spec landing upstream would not change that.
  //
  // 163 -> 177 is the `persona/*` family: the holder's own identity, specced
  // at trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#360 and implemented at
  // OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure#1255. The canonical total moved
  // 178 -> 207, which is 24 persona families plus the five `rooms/keys/*` this
  // library does not implement.
  //
  // **All twenty-four are here now, and the split between them is the whole
  // design.** The family has two halves, and until the console gained a persona
  // pane only one of them was implementable.
  //
  // `persona/attribute/*`, `persona/profile/*`, `persona/binding/set`,
  // `persona/correlation/analyze` and `persona/disclosure/history` read or
  // write the agent-scoped attribute pool, which sits above every trust
  // context; the agent gates all ten on an *unscoped holder* credential —
  // `Admin` AND unrestricted scope, not merely an administrative role. This
  // note used to say those ten "cannot be" here, on the grounds that a wallet's
  // holder identity is scoped to a context and every call would come back
  // `e.p.msg.forbidden`. That was true of the wallet and wrong about the
  // library: `@openvtc/pnm-core` also backs the **management console**, which
  // administers an agent rather than acting as one inside it, and whose
  // operator can hold exactly that credential.
  //
  // So 177 -> 187 is those ten, in `admin/persona.ts` — the `admin` subpath,
  // never the root barrel and never `./persona`, so a wallet surface cannot
  // reach them by accident. CI greps the built bundles for their URIs and
  // permits exactly one file, `manager.js`, the same way it does for `admin/*`.
  //
  // The other fourteen are the context-scoped half plus
  // `persona/renderers/list` — disclosure's two-call gate, contacts, read-only
  // bindings, and the context-local profiles a wallet may author because
  // nothing crosses the boundary to build one. They live in `./persona`, which
  // stays wallet-safe.
  //
  // The two subpaths are not a filing convention. A single module holding both
  // halves would be one root-barrel import away from putting the pool's URIs
  // into the service worker, and the boundary would then be a comment rather
  // than something a grep can check.
  //
  // **Nothing is behind any more.** Every implemented family names the newest
  // version `vta-sdk` publishes: `vault/{list,get,upsert}` and
  // `provision/integration` at 0.3 (both the hex-digest -> `digestMultibase`
  // change), `device/wipe` at 0.2, `vta/credentials/issue` at 0.2. The last of
  // those was a *removal* rather than a deprecation — VTI dropped the 0.1
  // constant outright — which is why it surfaced in the check above as a URI
  // the agent does not name, rather than as a deprecation warning. That is the
  // expected shape of a cutover here: nothing is deployed, so neither side
  // keeps an old version alive.
  // 188 -> 194 is the rooms family, and the canonical total moved 208 -> 214
  // with it (six new SDK constants: `rooms/keys/{list,seal,chain}` and
  // `rooms/owner/{invite,issue-membership,issue-authority}`, implemented at
  // OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure#1320 and #1329). The six this
  // library gained are those minus `keys/chain`, plus `keys/open`, which was
  // canonical and unimplemented until the rooms pane needed to read a record.
  //
  // 194 -> 196 closes that: `rooms/keys/chain` (the delivery that repairs a
  // member reading only from where they joined) and `rooms/keys/present` (the
  // presentation oracle). The canonical total does not move — both were already
  // in the SDK and merely unimplemented here.
  //
  // **`present` was the load-bearing one, and its absence was not visible as a
  // gap.** Every host-served room task takes an authority presentation, and
  // nothing in this library could produce one — so `records/{list,get,put}` and
  // `epoch/mint` were exported, typechecked, and impossible to call. A count
  // does not catch that; the missing family was in a *different* half of the
  // surface from the ones it made unreachable.
  //
  // The three remaining `rooms/keys/*` — commit, key-package, welcome — are MLS
  // group operations a browser does not perform. They belong to whatever holds
  // the group state, which is the VTA, not this library.
  // 196 -> 198, and the canonical total 214 -> 216, are the two tasks that let a
  // surface reach a room's host without being able to address one:
  // `rooms/keys/backfill` and `rooms/owner/register`
  // (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#402, implemented at
  // OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure#1332). Both terminate at the
  // member's own agent, which is the whole point — the agent makes the host
  // call, being the party with a channel to one.
  //
  // Their host-served counterparts stay in NOT_IN_SDK and stay uncallable from
  // the console. That is not a gap left open: `rooms/create` and
  // `rooms/epoch/chain` are what the agent sends onward, and a second copy of
  // that call from here would be one that never arrives.
  // 198 → 201: persona/facet/{put,list,delete}, the holder's arrangement of
  // their own identity (dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#405, VTI#1338).
  // 201 → 204: rooms/keys/{read,browse} — the console reads a record through
  // its own agent, because `rooms/records/*` is served by a host it cannot
  // address (dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#426). The third is `rooms/keys/present/0.2`
  // and `rooms/owner/issue-authority/0.2` counting as new families beside the
  // 0.1 this library had drifted behind.
  //
  // 204 → 205 is `vta/webvh/dids/realign-keys/1.0` — the repair for a DID whose
  // key records are not named after the verification methods it publishes
  // (dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#456, VTI#1466 and #1470).
  //
  // **The canonical total jumps 227 → 235 in the same commit, and only one of
  // those eight is this task.** The other seven were always in the SDK and
  // invisible to the scanner: `vta-sdk` derives a growing number of constants
  // from the generated payload type rather than writing the URI out, and
  // `sync-task-surface.mjs` matched only literals until it was taught to
  // resolve them. So this is not the agent growing seven families — it is a
  // snapshot that had been under-counting the denominator, and with it the gap
  // this number exists to keep reviewable.
  //
  // 205 → 206 is `persona/attribute/purge-version/1.0` — removing an earlier
  // value the agent kept for a pinned face (dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#538). The
  // canonical total moves 235 → 240 with the snapshot resynced from vta-sdk
  // 0.45.1; the other four are families the agent gained since, not this one.
  //
  // 206 → 212 is the face lifecycle: `persona/profile/compose/1.0` and
  // `persona/attribute/promote/1.0` (dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#569),
  // `persona/profile/{retire,reinstate}/1.0` (#570) and
  // `persona/profile/{usage,timeline}/1.0` (#577). The canonical total moves
  // 240 → 246 with the snapshot resynced from vta-sdk 0.47.0 — exactly these
  // six. The resync also taught the scanner that a constant taken from a
  // generated `error_codes::NAME.code` is an error code, not a task.
