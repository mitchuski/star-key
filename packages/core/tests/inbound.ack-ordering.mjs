// The dependency contract this repo's R1.6 fix rests on.
//
// Everything else about persist-before-ack is our code; THIS is the assumption
// underneath it: that returning a promise from the inbound handler holds the
// mediator's ack until it settles. That is only true from
// @openvtc/vti-didcomm-js 0.6.2 — 0.6.0 acked first and ignored the return
// value entirely, and the range in package.json would happily resolve to it.
//
// So this test drives the REAL installed library through a fake socket. If the
// dependency is ever downgraded or the ordering regresses upstream, the wallet
// silently goes back to losing consent requests on an MV3 teardown; this fails
// instead.
