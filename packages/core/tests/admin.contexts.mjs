// Context deletion — the snake_case corner of the admin surface.
//
// `vta_sdk::protocols::context_management::delete` declares no `rename_all`, so
// unlike `acl/*` these bodies are snake_case. Both request fields are single
// words, which hides the difference; the response is not (`webvh_dids`), and
// that is where a casing assumption shows up as an empty list rather than an
// error. Hence a test for the one field that can silently disagree.
