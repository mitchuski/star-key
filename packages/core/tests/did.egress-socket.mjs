// The did:webvh host guard, proved at the socket rather than at a spy.
//
// `did.egress-guard.mjs` next to this file already drives the whole vector set
// through an injected `fetch` that throws, and that is the pass which can
// safely name `169.254.169.254`: a request built there cannot leave the
// process, so a run with the guard removed stays inside the sandbox. What it
// cannot show is *where* in the sequence the refusal happens. A spy that throws
// on call proves a URL was never handed to `fetch`; it does not prove a socket
// was never opened, and those are different claims once anything downstream of
// `fetch` — an agent, a keep-alive pool, a resolver that dials on its own —
// enters the picture.
//
// So this file is the other half, and it is deliberately narrower: **every host
// here names this machine**, so the request a run without the guard would make
// is a connection to a listener started three lines above it. Nothing can leave
// the machine even when the guard is gone, and the refusal is proved by a
// listener that counts TCP connections and counts none.
//
// ── Why these spellings and not the headline ones ───────────────────────────
//
// The vectors below are the ones where **this repo's guard is provably the
// thing exercised at the socket**, which is the whole point of the file. (Since
// `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js` 0.9 the resolver's own net-guard also refuses them
// by default — defense in depth — so this repo's guard is no longer the *only*
// refusal; the control below relaxes the dependency's policy to keep proving
// the fixture is reachable at all.)
//
// `didwebvh-ts@2.8.0` — the resolver under `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js` — has its
// own `isIPAddress()` check that throws "IP addresses are not allowed as hosts"
// for a dotted quad and for anything spelled only from `[0-9a-f:]`. So
// `127.0.0.1`, `2130706433`, `[::1]` and `[::ffff:127.0.0.1]` never reach a
// socket whether this repo's guard runs or not: a socket test built on those
// would pass with the guard deleted, and would be pinning the dependency.
// (`did.egress-guard.mjs` does assert them, but against
// `assertResolvableWebvhHost` directly, where nothing else is consulted.)
//
// A probe of the shipped resolver says which spellings it lets through to a
// real `fetch`, and those are the ones here:
//
//   - `localhost`, and `localhost.` with the root dot — names, which the
//     dependency does not look at at all;
//   - `0x7f000001`, `127.1`, `127.0.1`, `0x7f.0.0.1` — IPv4 in forms its regex
//     misses and the WHATWG URL parser rewrites into `127.0.0.1`;
//   - `127。0。0。1` and `①②⑦.0.0.1` — the same address written with an
//     ideographic full stop and circled digits, which the parser also
//     normalises.
//
// Each is pointed at the listener's port, so with the guard removed the
// resolver dials loopback and the count is non-zero. That is the RED state this
// file exists to produce, and it is why the vectors that would egress to a
// metadata service are left to the spy pass.
