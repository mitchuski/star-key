// A redirect is not a way round the endpoint check — proved over real sockets.
//
// `assertPublicHttpsUrl`, the did:webvh host guard and the library's
// `assertSafeEndpoint` all judge a URL's *text*. A 302 is how a host that
// passed that judgement sends the request somewhere that would not have:
// `https://vta.example` is vetted, answers `Location: http://169.254.169.254/`,
// and a `fetch` with the default `redirect: "follow"` makes that second request
// with no second vet. In a browser there is no way to inspect the hop —
// `redirect: "manual"` yields an opaque response with no headers — so the only
// control available is to refuse the redirect outright, which is what
// `guardedFetch` does and what `getVtaBearer` wires it in for.
//
// What this file pins is **the wiring**, and that is the part that lives here.
// The refusal itself is `@openvtc/vti-didcomm-js`'s; the decision that every
// VTA REST request goes through it is `vta/auth.ts`, one line
// (`guardedFetch(opts.fetch, vtaRestEndpointPolicy(...))`) that a refactor can
// drop without any other test noticing. `vta.rest-net-policy.mjs` next door
// would not: it drives the same function with an injected spy `fetch`, and a
// spy never redirects.
//
// ── Hermetic, and hermetic when RED ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two listeners, both on 127.0.0.1. One stands for the VTA and answers the
// redirect; the other stands for the internal address the redirect points at,
// and exists only to count connections. So the target of the attack in this
// test is a port on this machine: with the wiring removed, the redirect is
// followed to a loopback listener rather than to a metadata service, and the
// test fails on a count instead of egressing.
//
// `netPolicy` is the dev pair (`allowInsecure` + `allowPrivate`), deliberately.
// Without it the loopback base URL is refused on its address and the test would
// pass with the redirect control gone — green for the wrong reason, pinning the
// address table twice and the redirect not at all. With it, the address and
// scheme checks are both satisfied and a refusal can only be the redirect.
