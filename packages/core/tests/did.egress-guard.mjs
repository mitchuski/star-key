// for `BLOCKED_LITERALS`, and for a few of the numeric forms (`2130706433`,
// `0`, `017700000001`, `0177.0.0.1`, `%31%32%37.0.0.1`), an empty `requested`
// below is true whether or not the guard runs at all. Removing the CGNAT row
// from `V4_BLOCKED` fails the literals test and both stub tests above, and
// leaves THIS one green.
//
// That is a division of labour rather than a hole, and it is worth saying out
// loud:
//
//   - those literals are asserted against `assertResolvableWebvhHost`
//     directly, at the top of this file, where nothing else is consulted and
//     the dependency cannot stand in for the guard;
//   - what this test uniquely carries is the classes the dependency misses —
//     every name, and the numeric forms the URL parser rewrites into a private
//     address — which do reach `fetch` the moment the guard is gone. Those are
//     what make it fail.
//
// `did.egress-socket.mjs` makes the same claim one layer lower, against a real
// loopback listener, and for this reason it uses only spellings the dependency
// lets through.
