// The snapshot scanner, over fixture SDKs.
//
// `sync-task-surface.mjs` grew real logic — it follows `pub use
// trust_tasks_rs::specs::…` aliases to resolve a constant whose value is a
// generated type rather than a string — and the failure it replaced was silent:
// a task the scanner could not see simply was not in the snapshot, and
// `task-surface.mjs` then reported it as a URI **the SDK does not have**. That
// is the wording for a typo or a dropped task, so a scanner limitation read as
// a live finding. It cost an investigation before it was recognised.
//
// So the property under test is not only "resolves the forms we know" but
// "stops rather than writing a snapshot with a hole in it".
//
// Driven as a subprocess against a fixture tree rather than by importing the
// helpers, because the thing that went wrong was end-to-end: what lands in the
// file, and what the exit code is.

 * **Into the throwaway directory, never over the checked-in snapshot.** This
 * used to write the real `task-surface.json` and restore it in a `finally`,
 * which is a race rather than a cleanup: `node --test` runs test files in
 * parallel processes, and `tests/task-surface.mjs` reads that same file at
 * module scope. It saw either this fixture's handful of tasks — surfacing as
 * "task-surface.json looks truncated" and "implements 0 of 3 canonical task
 * families" — or a half-written file, as `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON
 * input`. Both reproduced only where the two files happened to overlap, which
 * on a developer machine with cores to spare is rarely, and on a two-core CI
 * runner is often.
