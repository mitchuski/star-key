// Every outbound Trust-Task document carries a verifiable proof.
//
// SPEC §7.2 item 7a lets a specification declare `proof` REQUIRED, and 93 of
// the 141 task types this wallet speaks do. Item 7 admits **no transport
// substitute**: the REST bearer, the TSP outer signature and the DIDComm
// authcrypt all authenticate the connection or the frame, and none of them
// says the party named in `issuer` vouched for this payload. A consumer
// enforcing the rule refuses the document with `proofRequired` before a
// handler sees it — which is what every mutating operation in this wallet did
// when the check was first turned on.
//
// These tests run the **real verifier** over the document as the counterparty
// receives it, rather than asserting a `proof` member exists: a signature
// copied from another document, or one taken over different bytes than the
// ones sent, satisfies the weaker check and fails the real one. That is the
// same reason the fixtures unpack with real crypto instead of inspecting the
// envelope before it is packed.
