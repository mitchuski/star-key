// specific and easy to miss: a module reaches for `window`, `indexedDB` or
// `navigator` at import time, everything keeps working in the extension, and
// the first server-side consumer discovers it with a `ReferenceError` after
// installing from npm. This runs the import a consumer would run.
//
// It also checks the `exports` map against the source tree, because an entry
// point that exists but is not exported is invisible, and one that is exported
// but does not exist is a broken install.
