// The layering, enforced.
//
// This package is on its way to being a library other people build VTA-enabled
// apps and services on, published from its own repo. Two properties have to
// hold for that to work, and neither survives on good intentions:
//
//   - **Modules import downwards only.** A consumer who wants `vta` should get
//     the VTA protocol, not the wallet's IndexedDB store and WebAuthn ceremony
//     helpers dragged in behind it.
//   - **No cycles.** A cycle between two module directories means neither can be
//     an independent entry point, however the `exports` map is written.
//
// Both were already broken when this test was written: `vta` and `vault` were
// mutually dependent, because the VTA's REST auth bootstrap lived in
// `vault/transport.ts`, so importing the VTA protocol pulled in the whole vault
// surface. That is cheap to fix in one repo and expensive to fix across two,
// which is the entire argument for having this test now rather than later.

  // `trust-tasks` sits BELOW `vta` rather than beside it. The two were one
  // layer while nothing crossed between them; then every outbound document
  // needed a Data Integrity proof (SPEC §7.2 item 7a), which put the signer on

  // fix the rule itself prescribes ("the shared part belongs one layer down")
  // and it costs nothing: `trust-tasks` imports only `didcomm` and `siop`, and
  // never referenced `vta` at all. It also tightens the check rather than
  // loosening it — `trust-tasks` may no longer reach for a channel.
