// The capability narrowing on an ACL entry.
//
// Two things are under test and they fail for different reasons, so they are
// kept apart deliberately:
//
//   * **The tables** are a hand-kept copy of `vti-common::acl`, because roles
//     and capabilities are ecosystem-local and there is no generated binding to
//     import. They are checked against `acl-capabilities.json`, the committed
//     snapshot `scripts/sync-acl-capabilities.mjs` writes. A failure here means
//     the agent moved and this library did not.
//   * **The behaviour** — intersection, the three write intentions, the two
//     refusals — is this library's own, and is tested against fixtures.
//
// Written with VTI#1268's lesson in view: a suite that only asserts refusals
// proves nothing, since a module that refuses everything passes it. Every
// refusal below is paired with the acceptance it is the boundary of.
